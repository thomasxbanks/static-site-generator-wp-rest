			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting 13 long years, any 90s lover who wasn’t outside playing &#8216;Pokemon Go&#8217; last night tuned in for the return of &#8216;Robot Wars&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show introduced a lot of new elements, effortlessly keeping up with the technological advances of today but it also didn’t change much at all by simply sticking to its core value and message that robots are cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time where comebacks seem to be order of the day, it’s no easy feat rebranding a classic that can compete with the modern market, just think of some of the brands that have tried and failed… Gap famously spent a million pounds on a logo which they changed back after just one week and MasterCard, who introduced their new Pentagram designed rebrand this month, tried something similar in 2006 but quickly reverted back to the original iconic logo. Even Steps made a comeback in 2011 (yeah, I don’t remember it either).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this trend becoming more and more popular, the brands who do crack the re-brand formula like &#8216;Robot Wars&#8217;, Old Spice deodorant and rapper Missy Elliott now all seem to be doing better than ever and with no end in sight, I’m looking forward to the return and re-brand of Blockbusters, Limewire and &#8216;Hey Arnold&#8217;.</span></p>
