			<p>The 3 Peaks Challenge is complete. Our legs are slowly starting to feel like our own again and we&#8217;re over the sugar highs and lows after a weekend fuelled by Haribo.</p>
<p>So now the team have caught up on sleep and are making more sense,  here&#8217;s what they had to say about the challenge which we admittedly expected to be &#8220;a walk in the park.&#8221;</p>
<p>How wrong we were&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Dan Nixon</b></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the best experiences I have ever had. Totally exhausting (both physically and mentally) but far beyond my expectations of what it would be like. And I&#8217;ve formed a bond with the other people on the trip that goes far beyond &#8216;work colleagues&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Sarah Purvis</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The toughest thing I’ve ever done. But totally worth it.  A testament to the people at Cube3 that we didn’t kill each other after 0 hours sleep, and kept on laughing even at the bleakest of times.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Clair Morris</b></p>
<p>&#8220;An unforgettable 24 hours. But really it was so much bigger than that. The months of training, planning and trying not to freak out brought us all closer together. And for us all to make it to the end of the challenge was a massive achievement. It just goes to show, with the right people behind you, you really can do anything.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Emma Levin</b></p>
<p>&#8220;I completely underestimated how mentally and physically challenging the 3 peaks would be. It was a grueling 24 hours, that really tested us as a group, and individually. But just like I expected, the support we had for one another was truly special, and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better group to complete it with.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Alex Rennie</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The highlight for me was Scafell Pike.We got great views of the Lake District from the summit. Then watching the sun set behind Wastwater on the descent was a special moment.We got to the bottom knowing we had done a lightening fast time and only had one mountain to complete – great feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Mike Mellor </b></p>
<p>&#8220;You spend most of the day waiting and waiting to climb a very large hill which you don’t really enjoy, 3 times. But strangely, it’s amazing fun and you feel really accomplished after it all.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Paul Irwin</b></p>
<p>&#8220;Both the most challenging and rewarding thing I’ve ever done. And such an amazing group of people to do it with. So proud of the amount of money we raised for such a great charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>**Burns his walking boots**</p>
<p><b>Chris Jones</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One of the most gruelling yet enjoyable experiences. It’s been on my &#8216;to do&#8217; list for so long and I can’t thank the team enough for dragging me through it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Dan Collins</b></p>
<p>&#8220;The walking was the easy element. The challenge for me was navigating 11 of my work pals up to the 3 summits safely and at a pace which was fast enough to complete the challenge successfully, whilst still being enjoyable for all. All was well on the daylight walks but Snowdon was, shall we say, &#8216;interesting&#8217; in the dark!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Adam Ashley</strong></p>
<div>&#8220;The toughest thing I&#8217;ve ever done &#8211; both mentally and physically. It was an intense 24 hours that felt like a full week, but made bearable and way more rewarding by doing with THE best team there to push you all the way to the finish.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Life now doesn&#8217;t feel complete if I&#8217;m not on a mountain.&#8221;</div>
<p><strong> Nick Morgan</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It was an incredible experience and one that you can&#8217;t help but feel had a lasting effect beyond the finish line. We&#8217;re definitely closer as a team and weirdly, although physically exhausted, feel mentally energised. High point for me was coming down out of the cloud covering the summit of Ben Nevis to see the sun shining across the mountains stretching out in every direction. Unforgettable.&#8221;</p>
