# Static WordPress Site Generator

## Feature justification by stakeholder
- **As a** content editor, **I want** to continue using the WordPress CMS **so that** I don't have to learn a new system.
- **As a** site user, **I want** a fast, efficient site **so that** I am not losing time or bandwidth.
- **As a** business, **I want** a fast, efficient site **so that** users are not put off by lengthy load times.
- **As a** site maintainer, **I want** a secure site **so that** I spend less time dealing with brute-force attacks.
- **As a** developer, **I want** a modular, templated build **so that** I can spend more time developing user features than building the backend.
- **As a** SEO manager, **I want** less dynamic content **so that** Google treats us as a well-positioned site.

## What do we want?
1. Nicely-organised folders of `.html` files
1. A folder of images
1. A `.css` file
1. A `.js` file
1. **All of the above** to be nicely minified for performance

_____

## What do we want to do?
1. Continue using WordPress as usual; changing copy, uploading new posts and associated images
1. The user will receive `.html` files on the front-end
1. The static pages must be as up-to-date as the CMS _with as little delay as possible_

## So what do we need to do?
1. Get the WordPress posts and page data
1. Create the required layout and populate it with the data
1. Write this to a static `.html` file
1. Drop any associated images into an `/images/` folder

### Caveats
1. **Only** do this to a page that has changed
1. **Always** do this when a change is made
1. Manual intervention **is** possible if it is *simple enough* to be done by non-technical staff

### Trickier stuff
1. `POST` form submissions back to WordPress
1. Rebuild any navigation if new pages are added or the menu functionality of WordPress is updated
1. Search functionality - Has to be dynamic and involves a database call/page build
1. Lazy-loading - possibly but belies the "static" part of the brief

### Nice-to-haves
1. Jazzy page transitions

_____

## What do we need to have?
1. Abstracted templates for ease of maintenance and modular development
1. Access to the WordPress REST API
1. Static file builder
1. Some kind of caching and incremental unique filenames for `.css` and `.js` files

## What is there already out there and why don't we use that?
Existing solution | What is it? | Why we're not using it
-----|-----|-----
[jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) | Static site generation | Compilation happens locally, no WordPress - uses markdown.
Other [Static Site Generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/05/02/top-ten-static-website-generators/) | Static site generation | Compilation happens locally, no WordPress. A lot of these are aimed at developers or tech-savvy people - it's not impossible but there's a learning curve that you probably don't want to pass on to clients and other content managers.
[Node on the server](http://cube-static.teamcube.co.uk/) | Dynamically build a static page when the user hits that page | Potential issues with downtime, no caching - each 'static' page is generated at the time of request
[httrack](http://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) | Convert a website to static pages using bash commands | Cube3 site took 2 hours to download, probably ages to FTP up too (`rsync`...?). Is a dumb tool, will just pull down everything - not just changes. Other than that, works pretty darn well - a few issues around loading fonts. Potential for running the whole thing through a Gulp task to minify and optimise before shoving it back on a server. Could potentially also host it through Git to update only the changes instead of everything.
[WP Static HTML Output](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/static-html-output-plugin/) | WordPress plugin | Didn't work during testing
[Simply Static](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/simply-static/) | WordPress plugin | Didn't work during testing
[Really Static](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/really-static/) | WordPress plugin | Despite many articles lauding it as the best plugin for this use-case, it is incompatible with newer versions of WordPress (throws a fatal error)
[JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) | "Modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup." | This is an excellent stack for building fast, efficient websites (including, but not limited to, static). Its unsuitability comes from its best practices being incompatible with WordPress - the content API is generated by something else in order to comply. A definite contender for future builds though but largely useless for converting existing sites.
[spike](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spike) (formerly [roots](http://roots.cx/)) | Static site generation with WordPress API hook for triggering rebuild on WP update (probably the best solution found so far!) | Uses deprecated API and [no intention to fix as yet](https://github.com/wkentdag/spike-wordpress/issues/11). Also throws an error when I try to include the `spike-wordpress` module.
[RooftopCMS](https://www.rooftopcms.com/) | Build any kind of website from modified WordPress API including live rebuild from custom webhooks | Buggered if I can get it working! `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` error - Contacted developers for issue resolution. Shame, because it seems to be the best solution!

### Further Research
#### Jekyll
Apparently, Jekyll **will** build from a JSON feed - _"you could have a cron check for the last update on your WP site, then kick off Jekyll build on a CI server, with Jekyll consuming an API."_

According to [the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/), Jekyll can take input from a JSON file and content is available using `site.data` in the template. This would need Node Fileserver to write the REST API response to a static JSON file for Jekyll to read. It's not the use-case this feature was primarily designed for though.

Jekyll also offers an "[import from WordPress](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpress/)" option but this doesn't import everything. It seems like a quick way to move over to using Jekyll but does not appear valid for this research.
>This importer only converts your posts and creates YAML front-matter. It does not import any layouts, styling, or external files (images, CSS, etc.).

Having tried to generate an archive page of posts using the Jekyll default template, I have decided this is unsuitable - the amount of work is prohibitive as this is not how Jekyll is supposed to be used.

#### JAMstack
This looks like a viable option for future developments - brand new builds. Using the JAM stack principles with WordPress as the content delivery system seems to be largely identical to the "Node on the server" option (see above). Replacing WordPress with a different CMS allows for greater flexibility on the front-end.

Options include:
- [Contently](https://contently.com/)
- [Directus](https://getdirectus.com/)
- [CloudCMS](https://www.cloudcms.com/)
- [CosmisJS](https://cosmicjs.com/)

A variety of pricing plans separate them, but they all serve an API of content to be consumed however you want - and that's all they do, allowing the front-end to be anything you want.

##### Honorable Mention
[RooftopCMS](https://www.rooftopcms.com/) - Use Rooftop CMS to build API-powered sites, with the WordPress UI for content editing.

## Issues
Things I have noticed during the duration of this experiment that are difficult or could prevent the viability.
1. The initial set-up can be tricky; the API return varies from site-to-site, resulting in a potentially large chunk of time sanitising the return data.
1. Retro-fitting this to existing projects is harder than doing it from scratch.
1. Not found a viable solution for updating only what has changed yet.
1. Menus (`wp-admin/appearance/menus`), unless hard-coded, are hard to get hold of without editing PHP, modifying core WP, or installing a [plugin](https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/209381/get-wp-navigation-menu-from-rest-api-v2).
1. Every solution using the REST API I have found so far requires rebuilding the entire front-end - no reuse of existing templates (not a problem for a new build but lots of work for a conversion - _**Update:**_ [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is Shopify's templating language and is similar to twig meaning we _may_ be able to leverage existing templates.)
1. WordPress as a true content management system is a big ask - especially when it comes to existing sites being converted. There's a lot of work that has to be redone rather than copied over. For example, when the site was converted directly into static pages using `httrack` there is a ton of WP specific code that would be unnecessary for a static build, such as the critical css output.
1. Have not found a way to trigger the "static build" on a **push** from WordPress instead of a **pull** from the browser or, at least, from a **pull** from a server.
