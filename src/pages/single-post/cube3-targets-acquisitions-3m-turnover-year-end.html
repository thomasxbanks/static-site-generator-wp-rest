			<p>2016 is shaping up to be quite a year for Cube3.</p>
<p>And we are excited to share our plans with you.</p>
<p>Commercially, we are aiming to reach turnover of £3m by the end of the financial year (the highest in our 17-year history), off the back of an increased income over the last 6 months to £1.3m.</p>
<p>So, what do we put it down to?</p>
<p>Well, these strong results, which include an EBIT of 27% for the same six-month period, are a result of our revised working model, launched internally and to existing clients at the beginning of the year, with the aim to roll-out formally towards the end of 2016. The improved structure has enabled our team to deliver a more agile and efficient end-to-end proposition, from strategic consultancy to brand and digital platform development to marketing execution through paid, owned and earned media.</p>
<p>Karl Barker, our CEO, also outlines his vision to “acquire or join forces” with other companies:</p>
<p><em>“Manchester has some awesome specialists. I admire agencies who have embraced collaboration as a principle, but in my experience I have found that collaboration is flawed and doesn’t tackle agile and efficient workflow.  Our model is built in true cohesion and we think it is a solution that tackles today’s marketing delivery complexities for agencies. This is not about building just to scale, but more a vision to create an agency model that effectively delivers end-to-end, disrupting the current status quo of a fragmented agency landscape.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>At the start of the year we received a six figure working capital investment from the Technology, Media and Telecoms team at Natwest.</p>
<p><em>“It is an exciting period for us. Natwest have been absolutely amazing, supporting us way beyond the facility.  We now have a great platform to further our ambitious growth plans, and the half year results are already giving a really strong indication that our plans will be in full flow by the end of 2017,”</em></p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to thank our clients, suppliers, partners and friends for their support so far. And keep watching, there&#8217;s a whole lot more to come&#8230;</p>
