As a high percentage of Rohan customers visit the website on a tablet device, it was more important than ever that the journey and experience was seamless across all devices.</p><p>Rohan has a rich heritage and history of adventure; it kitted out Austrian climber Peter Habeler for the first ascent of Mount Everest without bottled oxygen in 1978. But this wasn’t represented online, so we created a new Travel Stories area on the website, giving Rohan fans the opportunity to share stories and build a community based on a love of exploration.</p><p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400">The brand has come a long way since it was founded in 1972 in the attic of a house in Skipton, North Yorkshire and with their ambitious plans to increase sales by another 30 percent in the next 5 years, we’re excited to be helping them on their journey.</span></strong></p></div></article></main><footer id="colophon"><small>&copy; 1998 - 2017 Cube3</small></footer><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script>$(document).ready(function() {
