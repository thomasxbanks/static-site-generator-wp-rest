			<p>Vibrant culture. Creative flare. Industrial heritage. This is what Manchester’s NQ is known for. So it’s the perfect place for our innovative business growth consultancy. As a company of inventive forward-thinkers, it only seemed natural to find our home in the creative heart of the city.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKbSRdaEjE4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Our new 7,500 square foot office gives us plenty of space to expand, having outgrown our last office at Princess Street. The open-plan layout and industrial style of our new place was a great starting point, but by adding some striking graffiti artwork, installing a bar (of course) and setting up our trusty pool table, we’ve really made it our own. Now we’re excited to have a space that inspires creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>We’ve come a long way since we first started in 1999, and with an exciting business growth plan and an office to match our ambition, we really think you ain’t seen nothing yet.</p>
<p>In marketing, we know that change is the only constant. This dynamic and fast-paced industry requires marketers to continuously rethink, adapt and transform, or risk becoming sidelined when they should be at the heart of a business. With the goalposts constantly shifting, agility and innovation are vital to staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Globalisation and advances in technology create an increasingly interconnected world. A world saturated by customer touch-points, with more choice, more noise and more media pollution, all competing for the attention of the consumer. Today, simply selling is not enough.</p>
<p>But, this new world has also increased opportunity, for those brave enough to seize it. Those realising that despite all of this change, the customer remains at the epicentre. Those who recognise that there is no one solution. Agile thinkers and brave innovators willing to navigate the changing field of marketing and transverse traditional boundaries. Those who can ignite growth through innovation.</p>
<p>A brave new world requires a brave new us. And we’re ready. What’s around the corner? Who knows? But we’ll be at the forefront of change, no matter what. Living for today, innovating for tomorrow.</p>
