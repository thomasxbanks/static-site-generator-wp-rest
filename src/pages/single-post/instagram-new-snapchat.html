			<p>For something that changes so frequently, the Internet really does not like change.</p>
<p>Nothing causes more upset than when Facebook makes a minor tweak to its timeline layout. And that’s because social media sites, fully reliant on the content that we provide for them, are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">spaces.</p>
<p>And quite simply, we don’t like people messing about with our stuff.</p>
<p>But last week Instagram brought out the brand new Stories feature, and it has divided our office.</p>
<p>So I have done some digging on both sides of the fence, to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<h3>Instagram Stories: The Pros</h3>
<p>Instagram Stories mean we can be even closer to the lives of the people we follow.  Stories give us greater access to more (personal) moments from celebrities, magazines, brand and friends.</p>
<p>And at least it gives you the option to view them, or not.</p>
<p>Unlike Snapchat.</p>
<p>Kevin Systrom, CEO of Instagram says:</p>
<p><em>“If Instagram is built around highlights, we’re filling in the space in between &#8211; and becoming more about visual expression in general. We’re capturing all the world’s moments, not just the best ones”</em></p>
<p>So it all sounds like a bit more than just another way to celeb-snoop. We now have a way to share more, better.</p>
<h3>Instagram Stories: The Cons</h3>
<p>It’s not all gravy though. Whilst we all love being constantly connected to everyone we’ve ever met, there’s no privacy with Instagram Stories. You are not able to send individual snaps to particular friends, which means being that bit more selective of the content you post to your story, as EVERYONE who follows you will see it.</p>
<p>And that also means there is ALOT of content to deal with.</p>
<p>Maybe even too much.</p>
<p>With no way to filter out stories you don’t want to see, is Instagram becoming a place of too much sharing, and not enough caring?</p>
<h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>Instagram is a platform where people generally only post their best ‘content’ and moments.</p>
<p>And on Instagram, nobody wants to be ‘that guy’. Oversharing isn’t cool, this is about portraying the filtered version of our lives.</p>
<p>But, through Stories, Instagram has solved the issue of oversharing. The feed will remain the place where people can post their ‘best’ content, and stories will encourage people to share more day-to-day unfiltered moments, to be a little more silly and creative.</p>
<p>For brands, Stories will be a way to be able to share content without overwhelming people’s feeds. They will benefit from sharing exclusive content to their followers, behind-the-scenes at award shows, photoshoots, and interviews.</p>
<p>Some brands have already jumped at the chance to collaborate with influencers, fans and brand ambassadors. From Instagram accounts like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wearemcr/">@WeAreMcr</a> giving photographers the chance to take over their feed for the day, to music magazines like Billboard allowing famous musicians to do takeovers whilst at Rio, Stories does seem to have brought new opportunities for creativity.</p>
<p>It will be interesting  to see who remains loyal to Snapchat, and who will start using both platforms &#8211; what content will they decide to share on each? Will it be the same? Will brands share different content for each Story platform? How will it be differentiated? And how will that affect who uses each platform?</p>
<p><strong>When it comes to the Internet we can be sure of one thing, it’s just going to keep on changing.</strong></p>
