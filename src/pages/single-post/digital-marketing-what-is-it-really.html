			<p style="text-align: justify;">The core purpose of marketing has always been to build brand awareness and engage with the right audience in the right place, at the right time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few decades ago this used to be done in what we now call a “traditional” way; using methods such as print advertisements in magazines and newspapers, billboards, TV ads and radio spots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although we still see this type of marketing around it’s effectiveness is questioned, mainly because the place where audiences can be found has changed. Back then people used to spend most of their free time watching TV, nowadays people spend an average of 4.1 hours a day online; making the cyberspace the place to be in order to attract and engage with audiences. Because of this many businesses have either incorporated or completely shifted to a new approach to promote their services and products… this approach is called digital marketing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">What is Digital Marketing?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a nutshell, digital marketing is a term used to encompass all of your marketing efforts done online; including any assets and tactics employed to deliver your strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many assets that can be used in a digital marketing strategy, the most common ones being:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Having a website</li>
<li>Blogging</li>
<li>Publishing posts on social media</li>
<li>Creating content such as infographics, guides, e-books, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to defining digital marketing tactics, they would basically be the way you implement your strategy in order to achieve your goal. For example, if your main goal is to increase organic traffic by ranking higher in search engine results then you should be doing SEO.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes -if not most of the times- digital marketing tactics overlap each other and can be used together in order to make your strategy more robust. Using the above SEO example, let’s say that apart from ranking higher in search engines you also want to make your brand stand out and attract those people who have noticed you to your website; if that’s the case then apart from SEO you should also consider doing social media marketing and PPC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assets and tactics that you use in your digital marketing strategy will vary depending on several factors such as what your end goal is and the resources you have available, but if done correctly, you will still reap results no matter how big or small your strategy is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any other type of project, being organised and having a plan is key when implementing a digital marketing strategy. This will help you not only know what you are going to be doing and when, but also <a href="http://wearecube3.com/insights/the-importance-of-an-integrated-marketing-strategy/">keep your strategy integrated</a> and measure the success of your campaigns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A digital marketing strategy plan doesn’t have to be too complicated, the most important thing is that it outlines your goals, the assets and tactics you will be implementing, your target audience, time frames for completion, the budget allocated, etc.</p>
