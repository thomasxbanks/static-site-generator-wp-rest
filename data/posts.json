However, if done correctly, you can rest assured that your brand will be the one to come to your customers’ minds as the service or product to go for when they have a need.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Cube3 we believe that, at its most simple and fundamental, brand strategy, is about <a href=\"http://wearecube3.com/insights/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-branding/\">defining what you stand for and making it stand out</a>. We have broken down this concept into seven key stages to help you start building a memorable brand and establish long-lasting relationship with your customers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Determine your buyer personas and their needs</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The very first step in the brand development process is to identify who your buyer personas are and what is it that they are looking for.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Buyer personas are fictional representations of your ideal customers, which help you understand both your clients and prospects better. By doing research not only on your personas’ demographics, but also on what they do for a living, their education, financial situation, information sources and most importantly, on their pain points, you will have a much better understanding of their needs and how you can meet them. This knowledge will also help you tailor your mission, messaging, product development and content, to suit them better.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Define what you stand for</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you know who your buyer personas are and what they are looking for, it’s time for you to take a long look at your business and get a clear picture of what its reason for existence is: its goals, mission, vision, and the value it provides. Does your business have a purpose apart from driving profit? Does it really meet the needs of your personas and help them solve their issues?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And now that you are being introspective, take the time to also identify the essence of your brand. Because great brands are not simply just a promise of quality anymore; they make customers feel something every time they experience them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When defining your brand’s essence, think about your company’s heart, soul and spirit and try to relate this to the feelings you want your customers to feel whenever they buy your products or use your services.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Having a clear mission, vision and essence will help you gain the trust of your customers and help them know what to expect every time they come to you.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Know the competition</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Knowing who else is out there, what they do well and what they do not so well can help you identify the challenges of your business and give you reasons to stand out.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take a look at what your competitors’ offers; their products and services, their pricing structures and their customers. Try to understand how they communicate, is their messaging and branding consistent? Is there something that you could do better?</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get creative… literally!</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For many, the most fun part of the brand development process is the designing and creation of all the elements used to communicate and symbolise their brand; these include name, logo, tagline, website, typography and other aesthetics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When developing these elements, it is important to keep in mind that they all need to reflect your business and what it stands for. Building a memorable and strong brand requires consistency throughout all these elements (which means setting guidelines) as they will become the visual identity and recall of your business and mission.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Give your brand a bit of spark</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone has a personality; you have one, your neighbour has one, even that co-worker who sits behind you that you don’t really like has one, so there’s no reason why your brand should be the exception. Whether it’s super formal and mature or jubilant and a bit cheeky, giving your brand a suitable personality will help you define the way it speaks, acts, behaves and thinks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Position yourself</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And to do this, you need a value proposition. In a nutshell, a value proposition is a one- or two-line statement that encapsulates everything we have talked about above (your buyer personas, brand personality and essence, your business’ mission, etc.) and explains your product or service’s unique value and how they solve your customer’s problems or improves their situation; helping you differentiate your brand and build trust with prospects.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stay true to your brand</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you have created your brand, its personality and voice, make sure you are consistent and use it in every channel you use to communicate with your audience, in every piece of content you create. Keep in mind that you and your staff are your brand’s best advocate and therefore, you are the ones that have to live and breathe it. It has be something you can live up to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not being consistent and changing your branding constantly will only lead to confusion between your customers and prospects; making it harder for your brand to be memorable and recognisable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last but not least, make sure to integrate your brand into every aspect of the customer experience; from your website and social media channels to the way your phones are answered and the way your offices look. This will help you build a solid and authentic relationship with your customers, ensuring that they know exactly who you are and what they can expect from you.</p>\n","hero":{"alt":"Key stages of the brand development process","caption":"","full":{"filename":"Cube-Blog-imagery-041.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/key-stages-of-the-brand-development-process/Cube-Blog-imagery-041.jpg"},"thumb":{"filename":"Cube-Blog-imagery-041-300x156.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/key-stages-of-the-brand-development-process/Cube-Blog-imagery-041-300x156.jpg"}},"categories":[{"id":179,"name":"branding","slug":"branding"}]},{"id":7406,"title":"Digital Marketing &#8211; What is it, really?","slug":"digital-marketing-what-is-it-really","date":{"posted":"2016-12-19T13:25:03","modified":"2016-12-13T13:38:28"},"author":{"name":"Carla Gonzalez","description":"","url":"http://wearecube3.com/insights/author/carla/","avatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad01c39de42b2373116164c020aa49a1?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"excerpt":"<p>The core purpose of marketing has always been to build brand awareness and engage with the right audience in the right place, at the right time.

Back then people used to spend most of their free time watching TV, nowadays people spend an average of 4.1 hours a day online; making the cyberspace the place to be in order to attract and engage with audiences. Because of this many businesses have either incorporated or completely shifted to a new approach to promote their services and products… this approach is called digital marketing.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is Digital Marketing?</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a nutshell, digital marketing is a term used to encompass all of your marketing efforts done online; including any assets and tactics employed to deliver your strategy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many assets that can be used in a digital marketing strategy, the most common ones being:</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Having a website</li>\n<li>Blogging</li>\n<li>Publishing posts on social media</li>\n<li>Creating content such as infographics, guides, e-books, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to defining digital marketing tactics, they would basically be the way you implement your strategy in order to achieve your goal. For example, if your main goal is to increase organic traffic by ranking higher in search engine results then you should be doing SEO.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes -if not most of the times- digital marketing tactics overlap each other and can be used together in order to make your strategy more robust. Using the above SEO example, let’s say that apart from ranking higher in search engines you also want to make your brand stand out and attract those people who have noticed you to your website; if that’s the case then apart from SEO you should also consider doing social media marketing and PPC.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The assets and tactics that you use in your digital marketing strategy will vary depending on several factors such as what your end goal is and the resources you have available, but if done correctly, you will still reap results no matter how big or small your strategy is.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with any other type of project, being organised and having a plan is key when implementing a digital marketing strategy. This will help you not only know what you are going to be doing and when, but also <a href=\"http://wearecube3.com/insights/the-importance-of-an-integrated-marketing-strategy/\">keep your strategy integrated</a> and measure the success of your campaigns.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A digital marketing strategy plan doesn’t have to be too complicated, the most important thing is that it outlines your goals, the assets and tactics you will be implementing, your target audience, time frames for completion, the budget allocated, etc.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">(<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mkhmarketing/8468788107/\" target=\"_blank\">Photo</a> by mkhmarketing / <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" target=\"_blank\">CC BY 2.0</a>)</p>\n","hero":{"alt":"Digital Marketing &#8211; What is it, really?","caption":"","full":{"filename":"8468788107_bb6c21b0e4_k.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/digital-marketing-what-is-it-really/8468788107_bb6c21b0e4_k.jpg"},"thumb":{"filename":"8468788107_bb6c21b0e4_k-300x108.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/digital-marketing-what-is-it-really/8468788107_bb6c21b0e4_k-300x108.jpg"}},"categories":[{"id":188,"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing"}]},{"id":7403,"title":"Why is branding important?","slug":"why-is-branding-important","date":{"posted":"2016-12-13T13:14:01","modified":"2016-12-13T13:38:04"},"author":{"name":"Carla Gonzalez","description":"","url":"http://wearecube3.com/insights/author/carla/","avatar":"http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/ad01c39de42b2373116164c020aa49a1?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"excerpt":"<p>In today’s over-saturated world, businesses rely more than ever on having a strong brand in order to attract new customers and build long-lasting relationships with them.

It involves every aspect related to your business and the way your customers perceive and experience it. It is the way you attract and engage with others and the way you position yourself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A good brand doesn’t just happen… it involves a well thought out and planned brand strategy which starts with defining who you are and what you stand for. Your brand is born at the very core of your business and it is transpired into every action you take; the way your staff act, how you show yourself online, the way you communicate with your customers, etc.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why is branding important?</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a strong brand then it is more than likely that you have a loyal customer base that apart from keeping coming back to you, they also refer others to your products or services.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Branding is not only about making a promise of quality to customers anymore, it is about owning a piece of their hearts and minds. A clear and consistent brand provides value to your business that is beyond your physical assets. Take Apple for example; yes, their products are very innovative and efficient however, the reason why we are willing to pay any figure on their price tag is because we love Apple as a brand and we identify ourselves with what they represent.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A strong brand also creates trust by connecting with your customers emotionally; helping them know what to expect from you and making them feel good for engaging with you and not someone else.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last but not least, your brand motivates and inspires your staff, giving them a reason to feel proud of being a part of your team and to work harder in order to achieve the goals you have set for them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a brand strategy agency, at Cube3 we have three guiding principles that we follow in order to turn businesses into brands.

Totally exhausting (both physically and mentally) but far beyond my expectations of what it would be like. And I&#8217;ve formed a bond with the other people on the trip that goes far beyond &#8216;work colleagues&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Sarah Purvis</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;The toughest thing I’ve ever done. But totally worth it.  A testament to the people at Cube3 that we didn’t kill each other after 0 hours sleep, and kept on laughing even at the bleakest of times.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Clair Morris</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;An unforgettable 24 hours. But really it was so much bigger than that. The months of training, planning and trying not to freak out brought us all closer together. And for us all to make it to the end of the challenge was a massive achievement. It just goes to show, with the right people behind you, you really can do anything.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What’s next Cube3?</span></p>\n<p><b>Emma Levin</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;I completely underestimated how mentally and physically challenging the 3 peaks would be. It was a grueling 24 hours, that really tested us as a group, and individually. But just like I expected, the support we had for one another was truly special, and I couldn&#8217;t have asked for a better group to complete it with.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Alex Rennie</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;The highlight for me was Scafell Pike.We got great views of the Lake District from the summit. Then watching the sun set behind Wastwater on the descent was a special moment.We got to the bottom knowing we had done a lightening fast time and only had one mountain to complete – great feeling.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Mike Mellor </b></p>\n<p>&#8220;You spend most of the day waiting and waiting to climb a very large hill which you don’t really enjoy, 3 times. But strangely, it’s amazing fun and you feel really accomplished after it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p><b>Paul Irwin</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;Both the most challenging and rewarding thing I’ve ever done. And such an amazing group of people to do it with. So proud of the amount of money we raised for such a great charity.&#8221;</p>\n<p>**Burns his walking boots**</p>\n<p><b>Chris Jones</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;One of the most gruelling yet enjoyable experiences. It’s been on my &#8216;to do&#8217; list for so long and I can’t thank the team enough for dragging me through it.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><b>Dan Collins</b></p>\n<p>&#8220;The walking was the easy element. The challenge for me was navigating 11 of my work pals up to the 3 summits safely and at a pace which was fast enough to complete the challenge successfully, whilst still being enjoyable for all. All was well on the daylight walks but Snowdon was, shall we say, &#8216;interesting&#8217; in the dark!&#8221;</p>\n<p><strong>Adam Ashley</strong></p>\n<div>&#8220;The toughest thing I&#8217;ve ever done &#8211; both mentally and physically. It was an intense 24 hours that felt like a full week, but made bearable and way more rewarding by doing with THE best team there to push you all the way to the finish.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Life now doesn&#8217;t feel complete if I&#8217;m not on a mountain.&#8221;</div>\n<p><strong> Nick Morgan</strong></p>\n<p>&#8220;It was an incredible experience and one that you can&#8217;t help but feel had a lasting effect beyond the finish line. We&#8217;re definitely closer as a team and weirdly, although physically exhausted, feel mentally energised. High point for me was coming down out of the cloud covering the summit of Ben Nevis to see the sun shining across the mountains stretching out in every direction.

We’re capturing all the world’s moments, not just the best ones”</em></p>\n<p>So it all sounds like a bit more than just another way to celeb-snoop. We now have a way to share more, better.</p>\n<h3>Instagram Stories: The Cons</h3>\n<p>It’s not all gravy though. Whilst we all love being constantly connected to everyone we’ve ever met, there’s no privacy with Instagram Stories. You are not able to send individual snaps to particular friends, which means being that bit more selective of the content you post to your story, as EVERYONE who follows you will see it.</p>\n<p>And that also means there is ALOT of content to deal with.</p>\n<p>Maybe even too much.</p>\n<p>With no way to filter out stories you don’t want to see, is Instagram becoming a place of too much sharing, and not enough caring?</p>\n<h3>The Verdict</h3>\n<p>Instagram is a platform where people generally only post their best ‘content’ and moments.</p>\n<p>And on Instagram, nobody wants to be ‘that guy’. Oversharing isn’t cool, this is about portraying the filtered version of our lives.</p>\n<p>But, through Stories, Instagram has solved the issue of oversharing. The feed will remain the place where people can post their ‘best’ content, and stories will encourage people to share more day-to-day unfiltered moments, to be a little more silly and creative.</p>\n<p>For brands, Stories will be a way to be able to share content without overwhelming people’s feeds. They will benefit from sharing exclusive content to their followers, behind-the-scenes at award shows, photoshoots, and interviews.</p>\n<p>Some brands have already jumped at the chance to collaborate with influencers, fans and brand ambassadors. From Instagram accounts like <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wearemcr/\">@WeAreMcr</a> giving photographers the chance to take over their feed for the day, to music magazines like Billboard allowing famous musicians to do takeovers whilst at Rio, Stories does seem to have brought new opportunities for creativity.</p>\n<p>It will be interesting  to see who remains loyal to Snapchat, and who will start using both platforms &#8211; what content will they decide to share on each? Will it be the same? Will brands share different content for each Story platform? How will it be differentiated? And how will that affect who uses each platform?</p>\n<p><strong>When it comes to the Internet we can be sure of one thing, it’s just going to keep on changing.</strong></p>\n","hero":{"alt":"Instagram, the new Snapchat?","caption":"","full":{"filename":"cube3_blog_instagramstories.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/instagram-new-snapchat/cube3_blog_instagramstories.jpg"},"thumb":{"filename":"cube3_blog_instagramstories-300x156.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/instagram-new-snapchat/cube3_blog_instagramstories-300x156.jpg"}},"categories":[{"id":181,"name":"advertising","slug":"advertising"},{"id":184,"name":"creative","slug":"creative"},{"id":188,"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing"},{"id":183,"name":"social media","slug":"social-media"}]},{"id":7323,"title":"3..2..1..

A big hero image. Some over-sized type laid over the top. A call to action button. Then probably a row of three icons below that.</p>\n<p>In fact, the phenomenon is so prevalent that it has been gaining attention <a title=\"Bootstrap\" href=\"http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/\" target=\"_blank\">all-over the web</a> for a <a href=\"http://www.novolume.co.uk/blog/all-websites-look-the-same/\" target=\"_blank\">number of years</a> now. It’s the death of creativity isn’t it? It’s the industry taking their clients for a ride, right? Well no, actually. And here’s why: if a user arrives at your site and already knows how to use it, that’s a <a href=\"https://boagworld.com/design/why-all-websites-should-look-the-same/\" target=\"_blank\">good thing</a>. It’s just a case of knowing where to break the mould, and where to use patterns that are familiar. UX design isn’t the place to experiment. That rad new icon you’ve just designed for “settings” is going to confuse all of your users because they’re looking for a cog. That innovative new menu you’ve been working on is going to be useless if users have to work out how to use it.</p>\n<p>That doesn’t mean creativity is dead though. In fact it’s vital when it comes to communicating brand values. And they should come across at every point of contact.</p>\n<p>A brand’s personality lives in its colour palette, in its typography, in its photography, in the way it talks. Google even has a set of <a href=\"https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html\">animation guidelines</a> to outline what type of movement is on-brand. And too right – that’s absolutely part of the experience and another example of how creativity is essential in telling a brand’s story.</p>\n<p>At Cube3, we build brands that are intuitive to interact with and we put creativity at the heart of our process. We find it’s a winning combination.</p>\n","hero":{"alt":"Creativity isn&#8217;t dead&#8230;","caption":"","full":{"filename":"production-line-4.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/creativity-isnt-dead/production-line-4.jpg"},"thumb":{"filename":"production-line-4-300x156.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/creativity-isnt-dead/production-line-4-300x156.jpg"}},"categories":[{"id":179,"name":"branding","slug":"branding"},{"id":184,"name":"creative","slug":"creative"},{"id":177,"name":"web design","slug":"web-design"}]},{"id":7304,"title":"Cube3 targets acquisitions and £3m turnover by year end","slug":"cube3-targets-acquisitions-3m-turnover-year-end","date":{"posted":"2016-07-25T09:00:10","modified":"2016-07-25T14:34:38"},"author":{"name":"Clair Morris","description":"","url":"http://wearecube3.com/insights/author/clair/","avatar":"http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/21f27b55261350e1e07f9c8f4b5548d9?s=96&d=mm&r=g"},"excerpt":"<p>2016 is shaping up to be quite a year for Cube3.

The improved structure has enabled our team to deliver a more agile and efficient end-to-end proposition, from strategic consultancy to brand and digital platform development to marketing execution through paid, owned and earned media.</p>\n<p>Karl Barker, our CEO, also outlines his vision to “acquire or join forces” with other companies:</p>\n<p><em>“Manchester has some awesome specialists. I admire agencies who have embraced collaboration as a principle, but in my experience I have found that collaboration is flawed and doesn’t tackle agile and efficient workflow.  Our model is built in true cohesion and we think it is a solution that tackles today’s marketing delivery complexities for agencies. This is not about building just to scale, but more a vision to create an agency model that effectively delivers end-to-end, disrupting the current status quo of a fragmented agency landscape.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>At the start of the year we received a six figure working capital investment from the Technology, Media and Telecoms team at Natwest.</p>\n<p><em>“It is an exciting period for us. Natwest have been absolutely amazing, supporting us way beyond the facility.  We now have a great platform to further our ambitious growth plans, and the half year results are already giving a really strong indication that our plans will be in full flow by the end of 2017,”</em></p>\n<p>We&#8217;d like to thank our clients, suppliers, partners and friends for their support so far. And keep watching, there&#8217;s a whole lot more to come&#8230;</p>\n","hero":{"alt":"Cube3 targets acquisitions and £3m turnover by year end","caption":"","full":{"filename":"img_56811.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/cube3-targets-acquisitions-3m-turnover-year-end/img_56811.jpg"},"thumb":{"filename":"img_56811-300x156.jpg","location":"/static-site-generator-wp-rest/images/single-post-images/cube3-targets-acquisitions-3m-turnover-year-end/img_56811-300x156.jpg"}},"categories":[{"id":188,"name":"marketing","slug":"marketing"},{"id":178,"name":"public relations","slug":"public-relations"}]}]
