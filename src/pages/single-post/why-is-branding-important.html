			<p style="text-align: justify;">In today’s over-saturated world, businesses rely more than ever on having a strong brand in order to attract new customers and build long-lasting relationships with them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">But, what is branding, really?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Branding is much more than sticking your super sleek logo on every wall of your office and document you produce. It involves every aspect related to your business and the way your customers perceive and experience it. It is the way you attract and engage with others and the way you position yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good brand doesn’t just happen… it involves a well thought out and planned brand strategy which starts with defining who you are and what you stand for. Your brand is born at the very core of your business and it is transpired into every action you take; the way your staff act, how you show yourself online, the way you communicate with your customers, etc.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Why is branding important?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a strong brand then it is more than likely that you have a loyal customer base that apart from keeping coming back to you, they also refer others to your products or services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Branding is not only about making a promise of quality to customers anymore, it is about owning a piece of their hearts and minds. A clear and consistent brand provides value to your business that is beyond your physical assets. Take Apple for example; yes, their products are very innovative and efficient however, the reason why we are willing to pay any figure on their price tag is because we love Apple as a brand and we identify ourselves with what they represent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A strong brand also creates trust by connecting with your customers emotionally; helping them know what to expect from you and making them feel good for engaging with you and not someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, your brand motivates and inspires your staff, giving them a reason to feel proud of being a part of your team and to work harder in order to achieve the goals you have set for them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a brand strategy agency, at Cube3 we have three guiding principles that we follow in order to turn businesses into brands. To find out what they are, check out our blog post &#8220;<a href="http://wearecube3.com/insights/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-branding/">What we talk about when we talk about branding</a>&#8220;.</p>
