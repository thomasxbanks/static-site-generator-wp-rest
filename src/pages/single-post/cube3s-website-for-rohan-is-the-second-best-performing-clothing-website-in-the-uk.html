			<p>Our website for national outdoor retailer Rohan has hit the news this week for its strong website performance.</p>
<p>The improvement meant that it almost beat Racing Green to the top spot, and knocked Agent Provocateur from second place in the table of the UK’s best performing websites in Q3, a massive move up the ranks from 21st position in Q2.</p>
<p>The testing carried out by specialists for Drapers is based on quality, user experience, accessibility, performance and SEO capability.</p>
<p>The improvement in performance follows a strategy and insight piece into the brand which informed the UX, design and front-end build. As a high percentage of Rohan customers visit the website on a tablet device, it was more important than ever that the journey and experience was seamless across all devices.</p>
<p>Rohan has a rich heritage and history of adventure; it kitted out Austrian climber Peter Habeler for the first ascent of Mount Everest without bottled oxygen in 1978. But this wasn’t represented online, so we created a new Travel Stories area on the website, giving Rohan fans the opportunity to share stories and build a community based on a love of exploration.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand has come a long way since it was founded in 1972 in the attic of a house in Skipton, North Yorkshire and with their ambitious plans to increase sales by another 30 percent in the next 5 years, we’re excited to be helping them on their journey. </span></strong></p>
