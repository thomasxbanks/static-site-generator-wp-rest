    "content": "<div class='intro'><p>Using numbers in the title of a blog post is an excellent way of giving the (potential) reader an estimate of article length. <b>6 reasons&#8230; </b>will take less time to read than <b>22 reasons&#8230;</b> The nerds behind blogging platform Medium determined that <a title=\"The optimal post length is 7 minutes\" href=\"https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b#.jaszyyo9w\">the ideal blog post length is 7 minutes</a>. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should treat this as Gospel because blah blah blah blah.</div>\n<p>OK, I’ll admit it &#8211; you’ve been conned. There <i>is</i> evidence that numbers in the title generate an increase in click-through-rate but we’re talking a jump from 0.0% to 0.2% &#8211; nothing to <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">write home</span> blog about! This article is more about the myth of SEO and Content Marketing.</p>\n<h2>Goooooooooooooogle</h2>\n<p>Not breaking the habit of a lifetime, I’ll start by saying something controversial. Forget about SEO.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, SEO is Search Engine Optimisation &#8211; the simple idea that there are ways to fool Google into thinking your site is more relevant than it is. It’s a service offered by many marketing companies as well as being an add-on for web design companies and some companies even specialise in it. I say SEO is verging on a con because Google <b>never</b> publish their algorithms that determine where sites ranks.</p>\n<p>Love it or hate it, Google have a stranglehold on the concept of “searching”, to the point it’s <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/google\">synonymous</a> with the idea of looking for something on the internet. It makes sense that if most people find sites via search engines, that ranking highly on those search engines will drive traffic to your site.</p>\n<h2>If you write it, they will come</h2>\n<p>Pushy sales strategies are generally unwelcome &#8211; the shiny-suited geezer on your doorstep with a folder of insurance policies and a bullish &#8220;never-accept-no&#8221; attitude shouldn&#8217;t <em>ever</em> be the best representation of your company. Marketing blog, <a href=\"http://www.valuablecontent.co.uk/help-don%E2%80%99t-sell-talk-don%E2%80%99t-yell-show-don%E2%80%99t-tell/\" target=\"_blank\">Valuable Content</a>, promote a <strong>Help don&#8217;t sell, Talk don&#8217;t yell, Show don&#8217;t tell</strong> ethos that seems to be an excellent approach. They extol the virtues of <em>encouraging</em> users to make purchases rather than making them. Guiding consumers to making their own decision rather than telling them what they want, it seems, makes users more receptive and more likely to be long-term customers.</p>\n<p>I’ve read too many articles on numbers in titles, using questions, how three exclamation points garner more clicks than any other punctuation. In short, articles explaining how to generate clickbait (there are even <a href=\"https://www.impactbnd.com/blog-title-generator/blogabout\">tools</a> for <a href=\"http://seopressor.com/blog-title-generator/\">automating your clickbait</a>!!!). The issue with most of these articles is that, when I actually read them, they’re usually a bit crap! Often out-of-date, frequently poorly-written, generally weak content. A next natural step for Google, I&#8217;m sure, is weeding out clickbait.</p>\n<p>In short; keep your content relevant to your business, updated regularly, and interesting to the user and you&#8217;ll place correctly in the rankings. If you want to rank better, you should be better at what you do &#8211; not how you manipulate the results.</p>\n",

Logos in the top left, horizontal navigation just under the logo, copyright information right at the bottom of the page, buttons that look like buttons, search bars with a magnifying glass, etc. These are all things designers, UX specialists and developers have crafted, broken, modified and, importantly, taught users to use since the dawn of the web. They are tried-and-tested best practices that we&#8217;ve all learned to deal with. So, you&#8217;ve got a new website to build &#8211; do you copy/paste the last site you built, change the colours and deploy it or open up a blank Photoshop (other graphic design software is available) document and delve deep into your creative conscious for something truly mind-blowing? When should you use a square bubble?<br />\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-424\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/square_bubble-600x338.jpeg\" alt=\"square_bubble\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></p>\n<h2><b>The awards for design, creativity and innovation on the Internet</b></h2>\n<p><u><a href=\"http://awwwards.com/\">Awwwards.com</a></u>&#8216;s mission is &#8220;to discover, recognize, and promote the talent and effort of web designers, developers, and agencies who create unique digital experiences that are useful, innovative, intuitive, and beautiful.&#8221; and their site is full of examples of truly stunning works of art. A quick flick through the winners page shows a range of eye-catching techniques in use such as full-screen video, lush parallax and animation, immersive interaction, and a fair few lovely examples of messing around with typography. One thing they all seem to have in common, however, is that they&#8217;re predominantly portfolio or brochure sites &#8211; nice marketing tools, occasionally existing only for the duration of a campaign before rotting away on a server behind long-forgotten login details.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the world’s <u><a href=\"http://www.dollarfry.com/worlds-top-10-ecommerce-sites-alexa-rank-basis/\">top ranking e-commerce sites</a></u> all look a bit naff in comparison. But &#8211; and it&#8217;s a big but (no sniggering!) &#8211; they work. I&#8217;ll stick with <u><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/\">Amazon</a></u> here, partly because they&#8217;re number one on the list and partly because I use Amazon all the time so I feel more confident in dissecting their site. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be much disagreement when I suggest that don&#8217;t imagine amazon.co.uk winning any awards for their &#8220;useful, innovative, intuitive, and beautiful&#8221; website.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_422\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-422\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/side_by_side_comparison-amazon_publicis90-600x221.png\" alt=\"Amazon vs Publicis90: The Great Homepage War 2016™\" width=\"600\" height=\"221\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon vs Publicis90: The Great Homepage War 2016™</p></div></p>\n<p>Amazon takes the traditional approach &#8211; logo top left, search bar, hero carousel. This is a layout you’ll find floating around the internet like so many round bubbles.</p>\n<p>In contrast <u><a href=\"http://www.publicis90.com/#/publicis90\">Publicis90</a></u> have filled half of their screen real-estate with their logo and hidden the navigation almost completely until you click the little down arrow at the bottom. Incidentally, they draw your attention to this subtle button with a slick loading animation that builds the button as the content is served in the background. Irritatingly, the page doesn’t appear to scroll down when you click the down button but new elements animate into the screen.</p>\n<p>While I’ve been writing this article, I’ve been back to the Publicis90 website a few times and, by now, it’s starting to annoy me &#8211; it seems to have been designed for very infrequent use. It <i>does</i> look beautiful, the animation is smooth and fluid and, for all my complaining about the hidden navigation, it doesn’t take more than a second two figure out what you’re doing. It’s been well put together &#8211; I don’t want this to be seen as any sort of negative critique of this particular site!</p>\n<p>Amazon has invested heavily in its one solitary goal &#8211; selling things. Craig Smith over at <u><a href=\"http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/amazon-statistics/\">Expanded Ramblings suggests that 44% of online shoppers</a></u> go directly to Amazon to make a purchase which may well account for their <u><a href=\"https://www.quantcast.com/amazon.com\">2.7 million average daily hit rate</a></u>. Amazon has employed a wealth of tricks and clever thinking into making it appear that their site loads super-fast &#8211; no soothing animations or loading bars here because jazzy animation here is a barrier to sales.</p>\n<p>For Publicis90 on the other hand, the demographic they’re aiming for (digital creatives looking for funding) are more likely to follow the site through to its conclusion than be put-off by the measured pace of page loads.</p>\n<p>The most interesting thing to note is that Amazon actually loads slower. There was a factoid floating around the internet a while ago that <u><a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales\">Amazon loses $1.6 billion dollars a year</a></u> for every second their page load slows down. Again, a lot of effort has gone in to deferring loading of elements to fool the user into thinking it’s loaded quickly enough to save them $1.6 billion.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_420\" style=\"width: 530px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-420\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/screenshot-page_load-amazon-520x600.png\" alt=\"Amazon takes around 40 seconds to load - though you wouldn't know it!\" width=\"520\" height=\"600\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amazon takes around 40 seconds to load &#8211; though you wouldn&#8217;t know it!</p></div><br />\n<div id=\"attachment_421\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-421\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/screenshot-page_load-publicis90-600x272.png\" alt=\"Pulicis90 comes in at around a second.\" width=\"600\" height=\"272\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pulicis90 comes in at around a second.</p></div></p>\n<h2><i></i><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Design is beautiful, design is practical.</span></h2>\n<p>This is not too say that ecommerce sites can&#8217;t be beautiful. There are some lovely lush examples around but beauty and practicality aren&#8217;t mutually exclusive. Publicis90&#8217;s site certainly has practical elements: it renders well on mobile devices with large thumbable links and a slick, smooth, although pared-down animation on navigating around.</p>\n<p>One site that strikes a nice balance is <u><a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/browse\">Netflix</a></u>. The video-on-demand giant’s website combines traditional &#8211; logo in the top left, account and search in the top right, copyright at the bottom &#8211; with a quirky sideways-scrolling ‘bookshelf’ navigation that has reeled in 75 million users in <u><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDrfE9I8_hs\">almost</a></u> <u><a href=\"https://help.netflix.com/en/node/14164\">every country on earth</a></u>.</p>\n<h2>The right tool for the right job</h2>\n<blockquote><p>When it comes to the internet, there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The best way to decide whether you want to go for something ground-breaking or more traditional is to apply the old adage <i>the right tool for the right job</i>. When it comes to the internet, there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach. Consider your user, <u><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/making-like-a-mob-boss-knowing-your-problem-and-how-to-fix-it-2/\">consider your goals</a></u>, and create the right solution to solve the problem.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-419\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/right_tool_for_the_right_job-600x402.jpg\" alt=\"right_tool_for_the_right_job\" width=\"600\" height=\"402\" /></p>\n<p>Few things will drive users away from your site (and to one of your competitors) than using the inappropriate solution. However pretty your e-commerce site is, speed and durability come first. Likewise, few will be impressed by your creative portfolio if it looks like a discount supermarket.</p>\n",

Then, sorry, but you’re not going to get all of the bells and whistles! Do you have thousands of pounds going spare and are happy with it going live whenever? In that case, we can give you an all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza! Does it have to be live tomorrow and definitely ground-breaking cutting-edge perfection? Sure, but it’ll cost you!</p>\n<p>Educating clients will manage their expectations, and allow you to effectively manage the delivery of the product with as few headaches as possible.</p>\n<p>Where you can make tackle the issue is by iterating. Start with something good and fast, then work towards making it great. This will draw the cost out over a protracted period but ultimately leave you with the best of all worlds! This doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re giving the client something rubbish to begin with but, through education, guiding a client down this route will be beneficial all round. The client starts to fulfil their KPIs sooner, the cost is spread over a longer period, the development will improve with each iteration based on real-life feedback.</p>\n",

    "content": "<div class='intro'><p><strong>Who likes following orders? Better yet, who likes following orders blindly?</strong></div>\n<p>One of the knottiest problems to untangle in the product development lifecycle is that of the product roadmap. Used correctly it can be a valuable tool for communication with stakeholders, and simultaneously an opportunity to allow a product team the autonomy to focus on value and problem-solving. Used incorrectly, the product roadmap can single-handedly impede rapid development, fast feedback loops, and the ability to really get to the heart of what your customers need.</p>\n<p>The issue with the product roadmap is that it’s often only seen by high-level stakeholders involved with your product; and these are most likely the members of your organisation who are least familiar with the idea of agile, iterative software development. As such, the likelihood of a roadmap turning into a high-level, long term waterfall project document is unfortunately high. In these instances, development crews find themselves presented with a fully-formed, fully-specced feature (naturally, without the functional spec because we work *agile* here!), and are asked to implement it. In worse cases, these fully formed features that are thrown to a feature crew don’t even come with a rationale or justification behind them. The team is asked to build what they’re told, and they set about building what they’re told. Collaborative, no?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-384 size-full\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/h61073963.jpg\" alt=\"Because I said so! That's why!\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/h61073963.jpg 500w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/h61073963-16x12.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></p>\n<p>In the instances where this is the case, it’s the people most involved with the grass-roots of your product (and the people most likely to provide real innovation) that end up stifled. Think about it; a software developer spends every hour of his working day with your product &#8211; they knows its’ ins and outs, the backlog of technical debt that’s been accrued, the areas that desperately need improvement, and indeed could be improved quickly, if only the chance was afforded. They’re probably also keenly interested in the feedback received from the user base (if they’re not, they shouldn’t be working for you), and eager to explore opportunities to improve the product based on what the users of their (yes, *their* product) think. Developing a product roadmap which looks way into the future and demand a ready-defined feature from a dev team, not a problem to solve, cuts off this potential value at it’s neck.</p>\n<p>By its’ very definition, a roadmap is a series of directions or steps, outlined and designed to allow you to reach a predetermined endgoal. And, as such, by its very definition a ‘roadmap’ is constrictive, inherently waterfall; development teams faithfully complete each task as outlined, and (if the business is very lucky), the end goal may be reached, eventually. Alternatively, the roadmap will continue to expand forever, a never ending nightmare car journey with that relative you really dislike.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rebecca.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-386\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/rebecca-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"rebecca\" width=\"399\" height=\"299\" /></a></p>\n<p>This is an output-centric focus, and outcomes are unfortunately forgotten &#8211; because we’re on to the next shiny feature on the roadmap, and there’s no time ‘scheduled in’ for looking back (or worse, even when there is that time is 6 months later when it’s way too late). In cases where this happens, an agile approach is restricted to only be practiced ticket to ticket &#8211; and the real value-add which comes from company-wide adoption of this model is lost.</p>\n<p>Sound like waterfall? Unfortunately, this is all too often the case in organisations getting to grips with the idea of agile, and indeed the idea of product development. Some of the biggest companies in the marketplace who work ‘agile’ are sat arbitrarily t-shirt sizing features for a product roadmap (“only a rough estimate, we know we don’t have all the detail yet!”) two years out from development. And these will, inevitably, be the companies who are rendered obsolete by the businesses who have clocked onto the idea that this is inherently flawed. Luckily, a simple shift in perspective can change all of this, and for the better.</p>\n<p><strong>Got a problem?</strong></p>\n<p>Problem-focused roadmaps are an ideal way for spanning this gap. Don’t get me wrong, none of us live in a world where hard and fast business needs don’t come flying down the pipeline to disrupt well-laid plans (and frankly if I was saying that there’s a product methodology that should be followed blindly irrespective of the circumstances, then I’ve been drinking the KoolAid too) &#8211; but these should most definitely be the exception, rather than the norm.</p>\n<p>Building a culture where stakeholders can present you with a problem, rather than a ready-made solution or a feature to build, is the first step. Asking ‘why?’ at every available opportunity helps, too. The issue here is discipline &#8211; present a series of stakeholders with what is ostensibly a giant Gannt chart stretching wayyy out into the distance, with a whole heap of blank space at the end, will result in that blank space being filled very, very quickly with features, with little to no means to prioritise or justify why. The problem is that everybody has their own idea of what would be beneficial to build &#8211; and that initial process of identifying the problem statement is done upfront, by one person, quite regularly with no context as to why other than opinion. Encouraging a mindset where a problem remains a problem. until a collaborative effort defines a solution, is key.</p>\n<p>Additionally, asking a stakeholder why they need something, what value it’s going to add, and for who, allows you to effectively weigh that up against everything else you want to build &#8211; and more importantly gives you a level playing field on which to push back. If every problem can be measured against the same set of relative criteria, then you have a common base of understanding from which you can clearly explain whether something will get resolved or not, and why something doesn’t necessarily need to be solved this very second.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/53380319.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-387\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/53380319.jpg\" alt=\"Fix the windturbine! Do it now!\" width=\"404\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/53380319.jpg 500w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/53380319-16x9.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Further down the line, too, this switch in perspective allows you to achieve real outcomes for your product &#8211; you have a problem, so when do you know you’ve solved it for your users? This provides an additional level of autonomy for your stakeholders as well &#8211; giving them a results-driven understanding of when a piece of work may be ‘complete’, not just a timeline from when what they’ve asked for will be ‘done’. This flexibility allows everyone to focus on continuous improvement, and allows all your key stakeholders to micro-prioritise their features and become mini-evangelists for value, not just &#8216;stuff&#8217;; nothing need ever be ‘completed’, and everything built is always a propsect for additional iteration. If your stakeholder can’t give you a definition of success, then chances are you don’t want to be building what they’re asking for in the first place.</p>\n<p>On the flipside of this, a problem-driven roadmap also allows your development team to really get creative; giving a team a problem to solve opens up this additional avenue of value add, and allows this wealth of product knowledge to be applied in the most beneficial way for your end user &#8211; it encourages collaboration across the entire team (not just between developers), and the rationale for why we’d want to solve the problem is clear and simple, outlining succinctly from the off.</p>\n<p>So, the product roadmap &#8211; a blessing or a curse? Used correctly, it’s a brilliant tool for collaboration no matter the size of the team or the user base &#8211; and it’s an instant mechanism for championing value above &#8216;stuff&#8217;. Used incorrectly? Well, the article title kinda says it all.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/61812510.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-383\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/61812510.jpg\" alt=\"Fuck you, I won't do what you tell me!\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/61812510.jpg 400w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/61812510-300x300.jpg 300w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/61812510-16x16.jpg 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></a></p>\n",

    "content": "<div class='intro'><p>Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, websites ran the gamut from the bland to the Flash™-y and everyone wanted to make them better. Way back in them olden days, there were so many ways to improve the hideousness that some websites were, and so the web design industry flourished. Everyone clamoured for the best website &#8211; chasing the elusive &#8216;best&#8217; like a dog chasing cars.</div>\n<p>The funny thing about &#8216;best&#8217; is that its definition changes. It&#8217;s subjective; for some, best is &#8220;generates the most revenue&#8221;, for others it&#8217;s related to speed and performance, others still prize <a href=\"http://www.lingscars.com/\" target=\"_blank\">beautiful graphics</a> over anything else. And influencable (Is that a word? It is now) &#8211; some clients can be steered down a certain path by designers, developers, analysts foisting their definition of &#8216;best&#8217; onto the undecided and uninformed.</p>\n<h2>Google vs Independent Thought</h2>\n<p>Arguments abound over Material Design and the idea that Google is &#8216;forcing&#8217; people to design everything the same way. I rather like Material Design but, in my not-so-humble opinion, it&#8217;s not the be-all and end-all of future web design. What it <i>could be</i> useful for is tapping that wealth of knowledge. Google has spent a fortune researching all of this and, save <a href=\"http://tech.firstpost/news-analysis/15-things-google-got-wrong/106036.html\" target=\"_blank\">a few clangers</a>, they&#8217;re pretty good at what they do. Considering they have cash you can only dream of to throw at research and they&#8217;re pretty consistent with their continuing success, why wouldn&#8217;t you pinch a few ideas?</p>\n<blockquote><p>In a world where everyone can design and develop, we bicker over minutiae to gain a 0.01% lead over competitors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like with films and novels, unless it&#8217;s part of your profession to critique, you only notice really bad things or really good things. It stands to reason that overcrowding your site with graphics and text will make it harder for your customer to find anything. If your body copy is 8px apple green <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11582548\" target=\"_blank\">Comic Sans</a> on a bright red background and you&#8217;re hiding your most important call-to-action within the copy, you kind of deserve to have no customers! Beyond things like this, almost everything else isn&#8217;t critiqued. Sure there are some things that jump out as special but mostly you&#8217;re focusing on the journey, not the view. The aim of your site, function-wise, should be that every user remembers your site but no one remembers using it. Bickering over whether or not adding an extra 4px to the margin on a button to achieve a 0.01% return on investment (ROI) is slightly pointless. In short, seamless user journeys are far more important than font size. As long as you don&#8217;t balls it up royally, your site will be fine.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_343\" style=\"width: 230px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/comic-sans.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-343\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/comic-sans.jpg\" alt=\"Every time you use Comic Sans, a bunny gets punched in the face.

Anyway, the people that go to this site are after his words not his layout. It is readable and that&#8217;s pretty much all it needs to be.</p>\n<h3>Web design is dead. Long live web design.</h3>\n<p>The prevalence of themes and UI kits may mean a devaluing of web design but it does allow a new world order of King Content to reign supreme. In a way, a return to the old <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/5983574/remember-the-hilarious-horror-of-geocities-with-this-website\" target=\"_blank\">GeoCities</a> universe of people with ideas getting them into the world with little effort. We&#8217;re at a point now where most sites look pretty good so where can you make improvements?</p>\n<p>The places you <i>can</i> make massive differences are in the functionality of the site and by improving the experience of the end user. Streamlining processes such as sign-in or checkout, micro-interactions to provide instant feedback to users like instant form-field validation, and simplifying the navigation process to get your users where they want to go more easily, are the touch-points of your site it makes the most sense to invest in.</p>\n<p>This may well get me death threats from some precious designers but, sod it, there are enough gorgeous templates that actually work without much effort to spend weeks working out your padding and colour-scheme instead of focusing on the important things &#8211; your end user and the purpose of your site.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_346\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/death-threat.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-346\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/death-threat-600x338.jpg\" alt=\"My inbox eagerly awaits...\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My inbox eagerly awaits&#8230;</p></div></p>\n",

    "content": "<div class='intro'><p>Minimalism is an interesting thing &#8211; far from meaning as stark as possible, minimalism is the idea of removing anything unnecessary for base level functionality. Imagine a human face. Now remove all of the details you can until it still resembles a human face. If, for example, you took the eyes out and it looks wrong, stick them back in. Once you&#8217;ve finished you have minimalism. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/explore/minimalist-architecture/\" target=\"_blank\">Buildings</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism\" target=\"_blank\">paintings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vandelaydesign.com/beautiful-minimalist-websites/\" target=\"_blank\">web design</a> can all implement (and benefit from) minimalism. So can code.</div>\n<p>When I started coding for a living I had no idea about loops. The last year of solidly building WordPress sites has taught me a lot. I still start my code the same way I used to code though. I write everything out longhand, then work out the commonalities and parse them as variables, arrays, and loops. Then I start cutting out the duplicated code. Once I have this, I can start working out what I can cut from where to make my code as small and as simple as possible.</p>\n<h3>Who wants a DRY KISS*?</h3>\n<p>Every single developer! The reuse of code improves performance, makes updating easier &#8211; especially if the project gets passed to someone else when you&#8217;re inevitably hit by that bus that everyone goes on about, and benefits consistency across the design.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone knows that deadlines get in the way of perfection and sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to chuck something in that works rather than delay everything to produce code that will make other developers moist. This is where Technical Debt comes in. Set aside some time after deployment to tidy up your code. Think of it like throwing all of the stuff from your floor into a wardrobe when your mum visits. Your flat will pass muster for the duration of her visit but, if you don&#8217;t go and sort that wardrobe out once she&#8217;s gone, you&#8217;ll be in for a world of pain later on!</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_325\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/immaculate-bedroom.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-325\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/immaculate-bedroom-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"There are unimaginable horrors lurking behind those wardrobe doors!\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are unimaginable horrors lurking behind those wardrobe doors!</p></div></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like CSS classes; you wouldn&#8217;t apply identical styles to two elements when you could assign the same class to them and only write one bit of CSS, so why do it with your PHP or JavaScript? I start by breaking a build down into independent functions. Then breaking those independent functions down into independent pieces of functionality. This allows me to reuse a function again and again. For example, on one site I built recently, we needed a <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a>-style &#8216;bookshelf&#8217; that scrolled sideways. This had to start on click of a button or swipe on a touch-screen. It also had to work on several &#8216;shelves&#8217; independently of each other. By separating the function that made the shelf slide, I could call that one function on each shelf for each method of initiation. This made this one function simple to adjust, easy to replace if a better solution presented itself, and extensible for use on infinite shelves.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_338\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-338\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png\" alt=\"Code, like Dr Evil, is better when's it's Mini Me\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png 599w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable-16x11.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Code, like Dr Evil, is better when&#8217;s it&#8217;s Mini Me</p></div></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author)\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hunt</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(author)\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Thomas</a> originally intended their principle for use in software engineering but it is sound practice for almost all aspects of development.

    "content": "<div class='intro'><p>Everyone understands the importance of being able to predict the future. And as software teams, we’re asked to do this a <b>lot</b><i>.</i> Like it or not, there’s any number of stakeholders working with, or affected by, your project, and one of the things they’re going to be particularly concerned about is the delivery date. It’s an inevitable part of the software development process. Sometimes, they’re the people paying for it. Sometimes, they’re the people marketing it. Sometimes, whether you get paid or not depends on it.</div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_300\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17fy5m0mqye05jpg1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-300\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17fy5m0mqye05jpg1-600x338.jpg\" alt=\"A sterling example of the benefits of predicting the future.\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sterling example of the benefits of predicting the future.</p></div></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this world of agile and scrum and kanban and waterfall and kanbanterfall and all of the other wonderful software project methodologies, you’re going to run into the tension between the certainty of a delivery date, and the certainty that you don’t know enough to make that call. And, not getting into the whole ‘estimation is a myth’ debate (that’s for another article), for the sake of argument today I’m going to acknowledge that there are a number of ways to predict the future, and that some of them may be more accurate than others.</p>\n<p>Story pointing is a pretty long-held method of predicting the perceived effort involved in the delivery of a feature, and is often the tool used to extrapolate those estimates into a delivery date, on the basis of historical trends in your team. The idea is that we start with the smallest estimate for the smallest feature we can think of, and then everything else is estimated in relation to this: so, changing the colour of a button may be a ‘2’ (2 means nothing), whereas changing the size and position of that button may be anywhere from a ‘3’ to a ‘100’ (again, the number means nothing) depending on complexity. If we don’t have enough information to assign a perceived ‘effort’ against a ticket, or if the estimation we have arrived at is too big, we go back to the drawing board, breaking the feature down further where we can, and gathering enough information in order to be able to decide on how much effort we think the ticket might take.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the numbers you assign inherit meaning as your workflow becomes established within the team: after a prolonged period of time, you team can get so accurate at this (and so familiar with their own process and ways of working) that ‘2’ can subsequently translate to 3 days from development to completion of a feature for example. There’s a lot of negatives to this, and lots of teams make the mistake (and it is <b><i>very</i></b><b> easy </b>to do so) of directly equating points to time <em>way</em> to early in the process &#8211; but if you can do it right, it can become a reliable method for working out how long things might take to build.</p>\n<p>Arguably the most prevalent method for doing this is planning poker. Planning poker involves a deck of cards, each marked up with a ‘points’ estimate on a scale (estimation traditionally runs off the Fibonacci scale, so the order goes 1,2,3,5,8,13,20(sometimes),30,100 and so on). Each member of the team (and this exercise should involve everyone from the project, so all disciplines) gets a set of cards containing each number.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_298\" style=\"width: 473px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nautilus038.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-298\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nautilus038.jpg\" alt=\"The Fibonacci Scale.

The loveable snail of software development.</p></div></p>\n<p>The tickets for estimation are taken in turn, and the feature or problem we’re trying to solve is presented to the team. Once the feature has been explained, and any kinks or edge cases deemed important are nailed down in terms of approach, everybody plays the card they think reflects the effort it would take to complete the feature. If the numbers played don’t match, further discussion happens, and further hands are played until an agreement on estimated effort is reached. Points as mentioned are arbitrary, but any points assignation should be done based on previous experience. If you have none, it’s guess-work; and it should be widely known by all stakeholders that even if we’re guessing to begin with, this isn’t wasted effort &#8211; it’s a vital part of establishing a benchmark against which you’ll work in the future.</p>\n<p>This exercise is incredibly useful, in that it allows people of all levels of experience to outline what they think the challenges inherent to a ticket will be &#8211; and it means that an estimate isn’t arrived at based on one team members’ experience, because we want to remove as many dependencies from the process as possible; what if the team member who estimated the ticket isn’t available to do the work, and someone else has to pick it up for example?</p>\n<p>However, planning poker requires discipline; often these meetings can last several hours and can quite easily diverge into technical implementation discussions, wider product ambition discussions and so on, and the longer they last the less likely your estimates are to accurately reflect the work as attention wains. Estimation sessions, if not tightly controlled, can often become seen as a bit of a chore and a waste of time &#8211; and the more people involved (which by rights there should be to ensure a balanced set of views are represented), the more expensive they become.</p>\n<p>So, how can we make this process just as accurate, but shorter and less time-consuming for everyone involved? Another approach to try (that in my experience works particularly well) is called ‘Silent Grouping.’</p>\n<p>Silent grouping (i’m not going to lie) looks a bit weird. The basic idea is that all of the tickets you want to estimate are stuck to a great big whiteboard in an unprioritised column. Next to this are a further series of columns, split by your estimation flavour of choice &#8211; this could be time, points, t-shirt sizing, kittens, whatever you use. Each ticket should have the story detail associated with it to enough of a level that everybody should be able to understand the task at hand.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_302\" style=\"width: 492px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kittens.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-302\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kittens.jpg\" alt=\"These kittens mean nothing.

They are a metaphorical representation of perceived effort. Deep.</p></div></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the session, the tickets are outlined by the BA/PM and any obvious questions or edge cases/considerations are nailed down to ensure everybody understands the work required for each of the tickets. Once this briefing is complete, the entire team lines up in front of the board. From this point forward it is <b>absolutely essential</b> that no-one speaks. No discussion should be had between now and when the exercise is completed.</p>\n<p>One by one, each team member picks up a ticket (in any order from the batch of tickets) and places it in the column that they think most accurately represents the work involved in the task. The person taking their turn can also elect to move a ticket that has already been assigned an estimate if they feel the estimate already given doesn’t reflect the work involved. This process is continued in multiple cycles until all tickets are assigned to a column on the board, and tickets are no longer being swapped from column to column.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_297\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_ml4r2etFcA1rok2afo1_500.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-297\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_ml4r2etFcA1rok2afo1_500.gif\" alt=\"Although dancing, all of the people in this image are silent. Silently grouping. Always grouping.\" width=\"500\" height=\"272\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although dancing, all of the people in this image are silent. Silently grouping. Always grouping.</p></div></p>\n<p>The beauty with the process of silent grouping is that removing the discussion element from the process has a threefold impact:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>It’s fairer. </b>Teams are made up of a wide range of personalities, and it can become easy during a traditional planning poker session for the loudest personality to dominate the discussions. Silent grouping removes this element, allowing each person to silently contribute their opinion, affording equal weight to everyone.</li>\n<li><b>It improves accuracy. </b>Removing the discussion element allows people to focus on the tasks for estimation personally. Any feature we build involves a multitude of complex processes, and during a traditional estimation session it would be impossible to cover all of these in detail as a group &#8211; there’s just too much to consider. Silent grouping allows each member of the team to consider each ticket individually and from their own perspective, and as such it usually results in a more well-rounded consideration of both the task at hand and any potential pitfalls that may arise</li>\n<li><b>It can save time. </b>Surprisingly enough, and probably as a direct consequence of point (2), silent grouping disagreements over the weight of a ticket often sort themselves out in a couple of cycles. The fact that each person can consider tickets individually and without input from other team members means that each person can come to their own conclusions about the reason behind a disagreement, and challenge themselves to determine why someone else may consider a ticket bigger or smaller than they would. This can neutralise any lengthy debate process that can often arise in a traditional planning poker session, making the process much quicker.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the process sounds like it may be a lengthy one, it’s been consistently suggested that once silent grouping is embedded as a process within a team, it can reduce the time taken to estimate stories significantly to a fraction of what it takes to complete a traditional planning poker session, whilst simultaneously improving accuracy. The fact that the process is accelerated also means that an estimation session can become something the team actively looks forward to, rather than becoming a source of dread.</p>\n<p>So, silent grouping &#8211; remember, if you’re going to have to predict the future, it’s best to do it <i>quietly</i>.</p>\n",

And as such they are much more likely to hit on one of your blog posts than your homepage. Similarly, the prevalence of social sharing networks means that people are more likely to put one of your articles / photos / posts on their Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Google+ (maybe) than they are to &#8220;share&#8221; your homepage.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_214\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-214\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shop-window-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Shop Window\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Captivate the passers-by with a lovely display</p></div></p>\n<p>A homepage is traditionally a shop window; sprinkle a little bit of everything on it to give people a taste of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it &#8211; and impress them enough and they&#8217;ll click through to another page. This was the primary user journey in the early noughties, and to be fair still is in many cases. I can think of a few sites I regularly go straight to the homepage of and browse around from there; amazon.co.uk, BBC iPlayer, Netflix, Google (obviously!). But these are all large-scale, well-known sites that benefit from their established prestige. The majority of other sites I frequent, stackoverflow, Creative Bloq, Metro, etc. I get to from search results for specific things; from articles posted on news aggregation apps and from social media. I genuinely have no idea what stackoverflow&#8217;s homepage looks like!</p>\n<p>Media giant <a title=\"The New York Times\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> has reported a drop in homepage activity of around 10% over a three year period, citing the majority of their traffic coming from search engines resulting in specific pages being targeted. <a title=\"Buzzfeed UK\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/?country=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Buzzfeed</a>&#8216;s &#8220;side-door&#8221; traffic accounts for over a third of activity, and The <a title=\"Wall Street Journal\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/europe\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a> indicates less than half (around 40%) of their traffic hits the homepage. Admittedly, these are all news sites, and the rise of readily available push-based snippets of news through social media can account for some of the drop. But the trend remains apparent; readers target individual articles rather than browsing from the &#8220;start&#8221; of your site.</p>\n<p>Studying the impact this has on the traditional user journey draws an interesting conclusion &#8211; the well-establish flow from homepage to page via navigation appears to be on the way out.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t put effort into a homepage; a <a title=\"Wrist\" href=\"http://www.wrist.im/\" target=\"_blank\">well-thought-out homepage</a> can truly be <a title=\"Pomodrone\" href=\"http://www.pomodrone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a thing of beauty</a>, but considering your content and audience how many people are really going to see it?</p>\n<p>To summarise; as our benevolent supreme leader Google gets more and more powerful, a significant number of users make their way onto your site via pages other than your homepage. OK, I&#8217;m not quite ready to declare the homepage dead just yet &#8211; but I am willing to stick my neck out and suggest that if you have a content-rich or article-based site, it should be further down your list of priorities when designing or building a site.</p>\n",

    "content": "<div class='intro'><p>Let’s face it, Tony Soprano is a badass. Men want to be him, women want to be with him&#8230;he’s the epitome of power, control, &#8216;New Joisey&#8217; Italian-American mafioso cool. His leadership led the New Jersey arm of the mob to brush shoulders with New York, which (irrespective of divided opinion on what really happened at the end of season 6) is a pretty impressive accomplishment in anyone’s book.</div>\n<p>But how?</p>\n<p>The clue to his success in my opinion is his single-mindedness. He’s goal-orientated and entirely driven by one single objective: making money. His most successful endeavours on the show over 7 years arose from this single-minded dedication to one main objective, and his biggest mistakes (<em>Ralphie</em>, anyone?) occured when his interests were elsewhere. Arguably (not that I want to admit that he died at the end of season 6), the ultimate decision that cost him his life was one that didn’t align to his end goal; he put his relationship with his cousin above the main objective, which ultimately cost him his life.</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make here is that Tony Soprano would make a damn fine product owner. This sort of single-minded determination is absolutely key when approaching any sort of software build – be it a new feature for an existing product, or the first, shiny new website for your company that’s sorely lacking a digital footprint. All too often, software or web design projects are undertaken without simple, up-front analysis of the end-goal. And skipping this step in the planning process can massively decrease the effectiveness, and success, of the end result – and ultimately reduce the potential return on investment from your outlay.</p>\n<p>Take Tony. Tony has one goal: making money. Every decision he makes throughout the series is ultimately driven by this one, fundamental objective – and every option is weighed up in terms of the risks vs. the potential return in relation to his end goal. If the return is worth it, then risk be damned. If the return isn&#8217;t worth it, then it’s parked until a less risky alternative is available.</p>\n<p>Software development is exactly the same. If you’re building a feature, then the first thing you need to work out, before you even start discussing what the feature is, is the end goal. What is the problem we’re trying to solve, and what is the reason we’re solving it in the first place? Defining the answers to these questions at the beginning of the project, learning them by heart, writing them in 3 foot tall letters on the wall of the meeting room where all your planning sessions take place, and reciting them like a mantra at the beginning of every standup is good practice; it keeps everybody focused on the point, and it allows the decision making process down the line to be much, much easier.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_174\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wallpaper-paulie-walnuts-tony-soprano-1600-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"A traditional New Jersey Standup\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A traditional New Jersey Standup</p></div></p>\n<p>Take Tony for example: he has the opportunity to become head of the family when Jackie Aprille dies, but he chooses to give the title to Junior. Why? Because the FBI attention if he became boss would be a hindrance; and if he ends up in prison, he’ll greatly reduce his ability to earn. So the options available to him when boiled down to this level are simple ones;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option One: Take the position and potentially reduce your earning power when/if you get caught.</li>\n<li>Option Two: Give it to Junior,  keep the focus off yourself, continue to make the decisions and increase your potential income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though there are a few steps in the process before ultimately getting back to the bottom line here, the eventual outcome is aligned back to the end goal. And that means the decision is the most effective one, as it&#8217;s based on the task at hand and what you&#8217;re trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Likewise with software: take a bug found 2 weeks into a 4 week project. This bug, after analysis, may defer the release of your new feature or website by an additional 2 weeks if you fix it. But it can just as easily be left as it is and fixed at a later date, with little impact to your ultimate objective. Deciding whether you fix the bug now, or later, is easy if you have the end goal defined up front – does fixing the bug takes us a step closer to solving the problem, or will it have no impact on the problem we’re trying to solve? If you don’t know the answer to these questions, you don’t have a baseline for which to weigh up and compare cost-benefit down the line, once the project is underway and those inevitable glitches emerge.</p>\n<p>Another important benefit when defining your problem statement and the goal you’re trying to achieve up front is the fact that you can ensure that whatever the end result is, it’s <b>measurable</b>. Your problem might be that customers are not able to find the FAQs page on your website for example (which means you&#8217;re receiving increased calls to your support desk). If you decide that you can solve this problem by dropping a prominent call to action on every page within the site that directs people to FAQs, then you can easily establish the KPIs which determine if your new feature has been a success. If we know that now 90% of customers don’t go to the FAQs page before calling the helpdesk, then we can establish that a drop of 15% to this figure would be a success – and this means our productive output is quantifiable in terms of value. If we don’t have the ability to measure whether the feature is a success at the moment (other than less complaints from the support team), then we can potentially look at including some statistic tracking or analytics as part of the feature build, to start measuring this value from the point of implementation.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_177\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-177\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tony-oil-painting-600x347.png\" alt=\"Measuring success. In this instance, the measure is how many oil paintings of yourself you own.\" width=\"600\" height=\"347\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Measuring success. In this instance, the measure is how many oil paintings of yourself you own.</p></div></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is a powerful thing – by establishing the value you’re trying to add, and who you’re trying to add it for, then you are acknowledging the purpose of what you’re building, who it’s for, and why. This allows you to start seeing the value of the investment you’re making into your digital endeavour, and in turn allows you to make effective decisions based on solid cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n<p>The same is true for any digital project, not just for new features, but entire web builds – establishing the point up front can inform all of the decisions along the way, from design, to tone, copy, audience, required functionality, and development approach. If we know we’re building a brochure website whose purpose is to offer a simple digital presence and provide an easy means to find out where you are and how to get in touch, then the emphasis may be high on design, low on content, simple in terms of functionality but heavy on calls to action and drive to the ‘contact us’ section. We also know that we may want to invest time in establishing analytics and tracking so we can quantify the success of our brochure website and continuously make improvements to increase the conversion rate between visit and contact.</p>\n<p>If we’re building a new checkout process into an existing ecommerce website to ensure that drop-off rates and abandoned basket rates decrease, then we know that usability is paramount. We also know that  copy on that page (although used sparingly) can be key in providing an indication of how the process works to the customer. We know that functionality is more important than form here, because the end goal ultimately is to get more people buying your products and completing a transaction. If they’ve already put things in their basket and we want them to finish the sale, then it’s a matter of making that process as simple as possible; elaborate design isn’t necessarily the answer. And again, if we ensure that the end result can be tracked and analysed in terms of stats, then we’ve ensured that we have a backing in reality that informs any subsequent decisions as we move forward with continuous improvement – we can quantify everything we’re doing, measure the outcome, and determine whether the decision was the right one – and arguably more importantly, we can learn why that decision wasn&#8217;t the right one if it doesn&#8217;t achieve it&#8217;s goal.</p>\n<p>This value proposition also allows us to define our MVP – we know we could build everything, with unlimited time, money and budget, but do we really need to? These decisions become easier when we’re aware of what the point is – and also inform decisions about the technical approach we take. If this is simple, do we need to adopt the latest bleeding edge tech, or are we safe with implementing something off the shelf? If we’re unsure we’re going to fix the problem, do we want to invest too much money in the implementation, and do we also want to invest some time on A/B testing maybe, to allow us to measure the success of multiple different approaches to solving the problem?</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_176\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/james-gandolfini-6__130620020034-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"The ducks in this image are the metaphorical MVP. Deep.\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ducks in this image are the metaphorical MVP. Deep.</p></div></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ultimately, when you’re looking at investing time, money and effort into a new digital endeavour, keep thinking ‘What would Tony Soprano do?’ – because if you can align the project and everything it involves back to your problem statement, you’ll find those difficult decisions a lot easier down the line.</p>\n",

However inappropriate I really, really want to incorporate it into whatever project I’m currently working on. Refactoring an entire site to be Apple Watch compatible, scouring the web for the Next-Big-Thing in web design &#8211; parallax, salmon pink, enormous &lt;video&gt; backgrounds, working out if this blog is usable with Google Glass (probably not!).

Fingers crossed, it’ll be cool long enough for <a href=\"http://www.awwwards.com/\">Awwwards</a> to notice it but, ask yourself, honestly &#8211; hand-on-heart &#8211; does your client <em>need</em> all of this bumf?</p>\n<p>It all ties back to <a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/making-like-a-mob-boss-knowing-your-problem-and-how-to-fix-it-2/\">the end goal of the site</a>. It may be that the client wants a rapidly-dating, awwward-winning website and, hopefully, they’ll come back to you next month for the replacement because the trendiest color has changed and they want to “re-brand”. More often than not, though, a client wants to achieve something grander than that. Awards for being awesome are lovely but they’re not the be-all and end-all of your brand &#8211; just ask <a href=\"https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/s/6-reasons-leonardo-dicaprio-has-never-won-an-oscar-091733412.html\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>!</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Mind your fingers on the cutting edge</h3>\n<p>As with the bread-and-butter elements of design; typography, imagery, and layout, bleeding-edge techniques should be used when relevant and <strong>at no other time</strong>. You wouldn’t consider using this week’s <em>font-du-jour</em> without justification, so why <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><a href=\"http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/web-design-trend-2013/\">fixed headers</a></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><a href=\"http://www.gibedigital.com/blog/2013/september/02/is-parallax-scrolling-web-design-dead/\">parallax backgrounds</a></span> <a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/article/2900889/web-design-trend-predictions-for-2016-2017.html\">Material Design</a>…?</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<div class='intro'><p>Minimalism is an interesting thing &#8211; far from meaning as stark as possible, minimalism is the idea of removing anything unnecessary for base level functionality. Imagine a human face. Now remove all of the details you can until it still resembles a human face. If, for example, you took the eyes out and it looks wrong, stick them back in. Once you&#8217;ve finished you have minimalism. <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/explore/minimalist-architecture/\" target=\"_blank\">Buildings</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism\" target=\"_blank\">paintings</a>, <a href=\"http://www.vandelaydesign.com/beautiful-minimalist-websites/\" target=\"_blank\">web design</a> can all implement (and benefit from) minimalism. So can code.</div>\n<p>When I started coding for a living I had no idea about loops. The last year of solidly building WordPress sites has taught me a lot. I still start my code the same way I used to code though. I write everything out longhand, then work out the commonalities and parse them as variables, arrays, and loops. Then I start cutting out the duplicated code. Once I have this, I can start working out what I can cut from where to make my code as small and as simple as possible.</p>\n<h3>Who wants a DRY KISS*?</h3>\n<p>Every single developer! The reuse of code improves performance, makes updating easier &#8211; especially if the project gets passed to someone else when you&#8217;re inevitably hit by that bus that everyone goes on about, and benefits consistency across the design.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone knows that deadlines get in the way of perfection and sometimes it&#8217;s necessary to chuck something in that works rather than delay everything to produce code that will make other developers moist. This is where Technical Debt comes in. Set aside some time after deployment to tidy up your code. Think of it like throwing all of the stuff from your floor into a wardrobe when your mum visits. Your flat will pass muster for the duration of her visit but, if you don&#8217;t go and sort that wardrobe out once she&#8217;s gone, you&#8217;ll be in for a world of pain later on!</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_325\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/immaculate-bedroom.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-325\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/immaculate-bedroom-600x400.jpg\" alt=\"There are unimaginable horrors lurking behind those wardrobe doors!\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">There are unimaginable horrors lurking behind those wardrobe doors!</p></div></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like CSS classes; you wouldn&#8217;t apply identical styles to two elements when you could assign the same class to them and only write one bit of CSS, so why do it with your PHP or JavaScript? I start by breaking a build down into independent functions. Then breaking those independent functions down into independent pieces of functionality. This allows me to reuse a function again and again. For example, on one site I built recently, we needed a <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a>-style &#8216;bookshelf&#8217; that scrolled sideways. This had to start on click of a button or swipe on a touch-screen. It also had to work on several &#8216;shelves&#8217; independently of each other. By separating the function that made the shelf slide, I could call that one function on each shelf for each method of initiation. This made this one function simple to adjust, easy to replace if a better solution presented itself, and extensible for use on infinite shelves.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_338\" style=\"width: 609px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-338\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png\" alt=\"Code, like Dr Evil, is better when's it's Mini Me\" width=\"599\" height=\"398\" srcset=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable.png 599w, http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/reusable-16x11.png 16w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Code, like Dr Evil, is better when&#8217;s it&#8217;s Mini Me</p></div></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author)\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hunt</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(author)\" target=\"_blank\">Dave Thomas</a> originally intended their principle for use in software engineering but it is sound practice for almost all aspects of development.

And as software teams, we’re asked to do this a <b>lot</b><i>.</i> Like it or not, there’s any number of stakeholders working with, or affected by, your project, and one of the things they’re going to be particularly concerned about is the delivery date. It’s an inevitable part of the software development process. Sometimes, they’re the people paying for it. Sometimes, they’re the people marketing it. Sometimes, whether you get paid or not depends on it.</div>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_300\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17fy5m0mqye05jpg1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-300\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/17fy5m0mqye05jpg1-600x338.jpg\" alt=\"A sterling example of the benefits of predicting the future.\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sterling example of the benefits of predicting the future.</p></div></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in this world of agile and scrum and kanban and waterfall and kanbanterfall and all of the other wonderful software project methodologies, you’re going to run into the tension between the certainty of a delivery date, and the certainty that you don’t know enough to make that call. And, not getting into the whole ‘estimation is a myth’ debate (that’s for another article), for the sake of argument today I’m going to acknowledge that there are a number of ways to predict the future, and that some of them may be more accurate than others.</p>\n<p>Story pointing is a pretty long-held method of predicting the perceived effort involved in the delivery of a feature, and is often the tool used to extrapolate those estimates into a delivery date, on the basis of historical trends in your team. The idea is that we start with the smallest estimate for the smallest feature we can think of, and then everything else is estimated in relation to this: so, changing the colour of a button may be a ‘2’ (2 means nothing), whereas changing the size and position of that button may be anywhere from a ‘3’ to a ‘100’ (again, the number means nothing) depending on complexity. If we don’t have enough information to assign a perceived ‘effort’ against a ticket, or if the estimation we have arrived at is too big, we go back to the drawing board, breaking the feature down further where we can, and gathering enough information in order to be able to decide on how much effort we think the ticket might take.</p>\n<p>The idea is that the numbers you assign inherit meaning as your workflow becomes established within the team: after a prolonged period of time, you team can get so accurate at this (and so familiar with their own process and ways of working) that ‘2’ can subsequently translate to 3 days from development to completion of a feature for example. There’s a lot of negatives to this, and lots of teams make the mistake (and it is <b><i>very</i></b><b> easy </b>to do so) of directly equating points to time <em>way</em> to early in the process &#8211; but if you can do it right, it can become a reliable method for working out how long things might take to build.</p>\n<p>Arguably the most prevalent method for doing this is planning poker. Planning poker involves a deck of cards, each marked up with a ‘points’ estimate on a scale (estimation traditionally runs off the Fibonacci scale, so the order goes 1,2,3,5,8,13,20(sometimes),30,100 and so on). Each member of the team (and this exercise should involve everyone from the project, so all disciplines) gets a set of cards containing each number.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_298\" style=\"width: 473px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nautilus038.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-298\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Nautilus038.jpg\" alt=\"The Fibonacci Scale.

The loveable snail of software development.</p></div></p>\n<p>The tickets for estimation are taken in turn, and the feature or problem we’re trying to solve is presented to the team. Once the feature has been explained, and any kinks or edge cases deemed important are nailed down in terms of approach, everybody plays the card they think reflects the effort it would take to complete the feature. If the numbers played don’t match, further discussion happens, and further hands are played until an agreement on estimated effort is reached. Points as mentioned are arbitrary, but any points assignation should be done based on previous experience. If you have none, it’s guess-work; and it should be widely known by all stakeholders that even if we’re guessing to begin with, this isn’t wasted effort &#8211; it’s a vital part of establishing a benchmark against which you’ll work in the future.</p>\n<p>This exercise is incredibly useful, in that it allows people of all levels of experience to outline what they think the challenges inherent to a ticket will be &#8211; and it means that an estimate isn’t arrived at based on one team members’ experience, because we want to remove as many dependencies from the process as possible; what if the team member who estimated the ticket isn’t available to do the work, and someone else has to pick it up for example?</p>\n<p>However, planning poker requires discipline; often these meetings can last several hours and can quite easily diverge into technical implementation discussions, wider product ambition discussions and so on, and the longer they last the less likely your estimates are to accurately reflect the work as attention wains. Estimation sessions, if not tightly controlled, can often become seen as a bit of a chore and a waste of time &#8211; and the more people involved (which by rights there should be to ensure a balanced set of views are represented), the more expensive they become.</p>\n<p>So, how can we make this process just as accurate, but shorter and less time-consuming for everyone involved? Another approach to try (that in my experience works particularly well) is called ‘Silent Grouping.’</p>\n<p>Silent grouping (i’m not going to lie) looks a bit weird. The basic idea is that all of the tickets you want to estimate are stuck to a great big whiteboard in an unprioritised column. Next to this are a further series of columns, split by your estimation flavour of choice &#8211; this could be time, points, t-shirt sizing, kittens, whatever you use. Each ticket should have the story detail associated with it to enough of a level that everybody should be able to understand the task at hand.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_302\" style=\"width: 492px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kittens.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-302\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kittens.jpg\" alt=\"These kittens mean nothing.

They are a metaphorical representation of perceived effort. Deep.</p></div></p>\n<p>At the beginning of the session, the tickets are outlined by the BA/PM and any obvious questions or edge cases/considerations are nailed down to ensure everybody understands the work required for each of the tickets. Once this briefing is complete, the entire team lines up in front of the board. From this point forward it is <b>absolutely essential</b> that no-one speaks. No discussion should be had between now and when the exercise is completed.</p>\n<p>One by one, each team member picks up a ticket (in any order from the batch of tickets) and places it in the column that they think most accurately represents the work involved in the task. The person taking their turn can also elect to move a ticket that has already been assigned an estimate if they feel the estimate already given doesn’t reflect the work involved. This process is continued in multiple cycles until all tickets are assigned to a column on the board, and tickets are no longer being swapped from column to column.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_297\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_ml4r2etFcA1rok2afo1_500.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-297\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tumblr_ml4r2etFcA1rok2afo1_500.gif\" alt=\"Although dancing, all of the people in this image are silent. Silently grouping. Always grouping.\" width=\"500\" height=\"272\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Although dancing, all of the people in this image are silent. Silently grouping. Always grouping.</p></div></p>\n<p>The beauty with the process of silent grouping is that removing the discussion element from the process has a threefold impact:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>It’s fairer. </b>Teams are made up of a wide range of personalities, and it can become easy during a traditional planning poker session for the loudest personality to dominate the discussions. Silent grouping removes this element, allowing each person to silently contribute their opinion, affording equal weight to everyone.</li>\n<li><b>It improves accuracy. </b>Removing the discussion element allows people to focus on the tasks for estimation personally. Any feature we build involves a multitude of complex processes, and during a traditional estimation session it would be impossible to cover all of these in detail as a group &#8211; there’s just too much to consider. Silent grouping allows each member of the team to consider each ticket individually and from their own perspective, and as such it usually results in a more well-rounded consideration of both the task at hand and any potential pitfalls that may arise</li>\n<li><b>It can save time. </b>Surprisingly enough, and probably as a direct consequence of point (2), silent grouping disagreements over the weight of a ticket often sort themselves out in a couple of cycles. The fact that each person can consider tickets individually and without input from other team members means that each person can come to their own conclusions about the reason behind a disagreement, and challenge themselves to determine why someone else may consider a ticket bigger or smaller than they would. This can neutralise any lengthy debate process that can often arise in a traditional planning poker session, making the process much quicker.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although the process sounds like it may be a lengthy one, it’s been consistently suggested that once silent grouping is embedded as a process within a team, it can reduce the time taken to estimate stories significantly to a fraction of what it takes to complete a traditional planning poker session, whilst simultaneously improving accuracy. The fact that the process is accelerated also means that an estimation session can become something the team actively looks forward to, rather than becoming a source of dread.</p>\n<p>So, silent grouping &#8211; remember, if you’re going to have to predict the future, it’s best to do it <i>quietly</i>.</p>\n",

There&#8217;s a whole industry (or at least a facet of digital marketing) that has sprung up around Content Marketing that puts emphasis on copy-rich pages to draw consumers in.</div>\n<blockquote><p>Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience — and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. <a href=\"http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/what-is-content-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>The Content Marketing Institute</span></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>People look, for example, for &#8220;stakeholder management&#8221;, not &#8220;The Superduper Business Analysis Company&#8221;. And as such they are much more likely to hit on one of your blog posts than your homepage. Similarly, the prevalence of social sharing networks means that people are more likely to put one of your articles / photos / posts on their Facebook / Twitter / Instagram / Google+ (maybe) than they are to &#8220;share&#8221; your homepage.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_214\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-214\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/shop-window-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"Shop Window\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Captivate the passers-by with a lovely display</p></div></p>\n<p>A homepage is traditionally a shop window; sprinkle a little bit of everything on it to give people a taste of who you are, what you do, and how well you do it &#8211; and impress them enough and they&#8217;ll click through to another page. This was the primary user journey in the early noughties, and to be fair still is in many cases. I can think of a few sites I regularly go straight to the homepage of and browse around from there; amazon.co.uk, BBC iPlayer, Netflix, Google (obviously!). But these are all large-scale, well-known sites that benefit from their established prestige. The majority of other sites I frequent, stackoverflow, Creative Bloq, Metro, etc. I get to from search results for specific things; from articles posted on news aggregation apps and from social media. I genuinely have no idea what stackoverflow&#8217;s homepage looks like!</p>\n<p>Media giant <a title=\"The New York Times\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times</a> has reported a drop in homepage activity of around 10% over a three year period, citing the majority of their traffic coming from search engines resulting in specific pages being targeted. <a title=\"Buzzfeed UK\" href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/?country=uk\" target=\"_blank\">Buzzfeed</a>&#8216;s &#8220;side-door&#8221; traffic accounts for over a third of activity, and The <a title=\"Wall Street Journal\" href=\"http://www.wsj.com/europe\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a> indicates less than half (around 40%) of their traffic hits the homepage. Admittedly, these are all news sites, and the rise of readily available push-based snippets of news through social media can account for some of the drop. But the trend remains apparent; readers target individual articles rather than browsing from the &#8220;start&#8221; of your site.</p>\n<p>Studying the impact this has on the traditional user journey draws an interesting conclusion &#8211; the well-establish flow from homepage to page via navigation appears to be on the way out.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not saying that you shouldn&#8217;t put effort into a homepage; a <a title=\"Wrist\" href=\"http://www.wrist.im/\" target=\"_blank\">well-thought-out homepage</a> can truly be <a title=\"Pomodrone\" href=\"http://www.pomodrone.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a thing of beauty</a>, but considering your content and audience how many people are really going to see it?</p>\n<p>To summarise; as our benevolent supreme leader Google gets more and more powerful, a significant number of users make their way onto your site via pages other than your homepage. OK, I&#8217;m not quite ready to declare the homepage dead just yet &#8211; but I am willing to stick my neck out and suggest that if you have a content-rich or article-based site, it should be further down your list of priorities when designing or building a site.</p>\n",

      "rendered": "<div class='intro'><p>Let’s face it, Tony Soprano is a badass. Men want to be him, women want to be with him&#8230;he’s the epitome of power, control, &#8216;New Joisey&#8217; Italian-American mafioso cool. His leadership led the New Jersey arm of the mob to brush shoulders with New York, which (irrespective of divided opinion on what really happened at the end of season 6) is a pretty impressive accomplishment in anyone’s book.</div>\n<p>But how?</p>\n<p>The clue to his success in my opinion is his single-mindedness. He’s goal-orientated and entirely driven by one single objective: making money. His most successful endeavours on the show over 7 years arose from this single-minded dedication to one main objective, and his biggest mistakes (<em>Ralphie</em>, anyone?) occured when his interests were elsewhere. Arguably (not that I want to admit that he died at the end of season 6), the ultimate decision that cost him his life was one that didn’t align to his end goal; he put his relationship with his cousin above the main objective, which ultimately cost him his life.</p>\n<p>The point I’m trying to make here is that Tony Soprano would make a damn fine product owner. This sort of single-minded determination is absolutely key when approaching any sort of software build – be it a new feature for an existing product, or the first, shiny new website for your company that’s sorely lacking a digital footprint. All too often, software or web design projects are undertaken without simple, up-front analysis of the end-goal. And skipping this step in the planning process can massively decrease the effectiveness, and success, of the end result – and ultimately reduce the potential return on investment from your outlay.</p>\n<p>Take Tony. Tony has one goal: making money. Every decision he makes throughout the series is ultimately driven by this one, fundamental objective – and every option is weighed up in terms of the risks vs. the potential return in relation to his end goal. If the return is worth it, then risk be damned. If the return isn&#8217;t worth it, then it’s parked until a less risky alternative is available.</p>\n<p>Software development is exactly the same. If you’re building a feature, then the first thing you need to work out, before you even start discussing what the feature is, is the end goal. What is the problem we’re trying to solve, and what is the reason we’re solving it in the first place? Defining the answers to these questions at the beginning of the project, learning them by heart, writing them in 3 foot tall letters on the wall of the meeting room where all your planning sessions take place, and reciting them like a mantra at the beginning of every standup is good practice; it keeps everybody focused on the point, and it allows the decision making process down the line to be much, much easier.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_174\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-174\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wallpaper-paulie-walnuts-tony-soprano-1600-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"A traditional New Jersey Standup\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A traditional New Jersey Standup</p></div></p>\n<p>Take Tony for example: he has the opportunity to become head of the family when Jackie Aprille dies, but he chooses to give the title to Junior. Why? Because the FBI attention if he became boss would be a hindrance; and if he ends up in prison, he’ll greatly reduce his ability to earn. So the options available to him when boiled down to this level are simple ones;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Option One: Take the position and potentially reduce your earning power when/if you get caught.</li>\n<li>Option Two: Give it to Junior,  keep the focus off yourself, continue to make the decisions and increase your potential income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though there are a few steps in the process before ultimately getting back to the bottom line here, the eventual outcome is aligned back to the end goal. And that means the decision is the most effective one, as it&#8217;s based on the task at hand and what you&#8217;re trying to achieve.</p>\n<p>Likewise with software: take a bug found 2 weeks into a 4 week project. This bug, after analysis, may defer the release of your new feature or website by an additional 2 weeks if you fix it. But it can just as easily be left as it is and fixed at a later date, with little impact to your ultimate objective. Deciding whether you fix the bug now, or later, is easy if you have the end goal defined up front – does fixing the bug takes us a step closer to solving the problem, or will it have no impact on the problem we’re trying to solve? If you don’t know the answer to these questions, you don’t have a baseline for which to weigh up and compare cost-benefit down the line, once the project is underway and those inevitable glitches emerge.</p>\n<p>Another important benefit when defining your problem statement and the goal you’re trying to achieve up front is the fact that you can ensure that whatever the end result is, it’s <b>measurable</b>. Your problem might be that customers are not able to find the FAQs page on your website for example (which means you&#8217;re receiving increased calls to your support desk). If you decide that you can solve this problem by dropping a prominent call to action on every page within the site that directs people to FAQs, then you can easily establish the KPIs which determine if your new feature has been a success. If we know that now 90% of customers don’t go to the FAQs page before calling the helpdesk, then we can establish that a drop of 15% to this figure would be a success – and this means our productive output is quantifiable in terms of value. If we don’t have the ability to measure whether the feature is a success at the moment (other than less complaints from the support team), then we can potentially look at including some statistic tracking or analytics as part of the feature build, to start measuring this value from the point of implementation.</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_177\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-177\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tony-oil-painting-600x347.png\" alt=\"Measuring success.

In this instance, the measure is how many oil paintings of yourself you own.</p></div></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">This is a powerful thing – by establishing the value you’re trying to add, and who you’re trying to add it for, then you are acknowledging the purpose of what you’re building, who it’s for, and why. This allows you to start seeing the value of the investment you’re making into your digital endeavour, and in turn allows you to make effective decisions based on solid cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n<p>The same is true for any digital project, not just for new features, but entire web builds – establishing the point up front can inform all of the decisions along the way, from design, to tone, copy, audience, required functionality, and development approach. If we know we’re building a brochure website whose purpose is to offer a simple digital presence and provide an easy means to find out where you are and how to get in touch, then the emphasis may be high on design, low on content, simple in terms of functionality but heavy on calls to action and drive to the ‘contact us’ section. We also know that we may want to invest time in establishing analytics and tracking so we can quantify the success of our brochure website and continuously make improvements to increase the conversion rate between visit and contact.</p>\n<p>If we’re building a new checkout process into an existing ecommerce website to ensure that drop-off rates and abandoned basket rates decrease, then we know that usability is paramount. We also know that  copy on that page (although used sparingly) can be key in providing an indication of how the process works to the customer. We know that functionality is more important than form here, because the end goal ultimately is to get more people buying your products and completing a transaction. If they’ve already put things in their basket and we want them to finish the sale, then it’s a matter of making that process as simple as possible; elaborate design isn’t necessarily the answer. And again, if we ensure that the end result can be tracked and analysed in terms of stats, then we’ve ensured that we have a backing in reality that informs any subsequent decisions as we move forward with continuous improvement – we can quantify everything we’re doing, measure the outcome, and determine whether the decision was the right one – and arguably more importantly, we can learn why that decision wasn&#8217;t the right one if it doesn&#8217;t achieve it&#8217;s goal.</p>\n<p>This value proposition also allows us to define our MVP – we know we could build everything, with unlimited time, money and budget, but do we really need to? These decisions become easier when we’re aware of what the point is – and also inform decisions about the technical approach we take. If this is simple, do we need to adopt the latest bleeding edge tech, or are we safe with implementing something off the shelf? If we’re unsure we’re going to fix the problem, do we want to invest too much money in the implementation, and do we also want to invest some time on A/B testing maybe, to allow us to measure the success of multiple different approaches to solving the problem?</p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_176\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-176\" src=\"http://www.scrummable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/james-gandolfini-6__130620020034-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"The ducks in this image are the metaphorical MVP.

Deep.</p></div></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ultimately, when you’re looking at investing time, money and effort into a new digital endeavour, keep thinking ‘What would Tony Soprano do?’ – because if you can align the project and everything it involves back to your problem statement, you’ll find those difficult decisions a lot easier down the line.</p>\n",

However inappropriate I really, really want to incorporate it into whatever project I’m currently working on. Refactoring an entire site to be Apple Watch compatible, scouring the web for the Next-Big-Thing in web design &#8211; parallax, salmon pink, enormous &lt;video&gt; backgrounds, working out if this blog is usable with Google Glass (probably not!). Seriously, I’ve tried to shoehorn <em>all</em> of these things into a single website. The thing is &#8211; sure, that site looks <strong>amazeballs</strong>… for about a week. Fingers crossed, it’ll be cool long enough for <a href=\"http://www.awwwards.com/\">Awwwards</a> to notice it but, ask yourself, honestly &#8211; hand-on-heart &#8211; does your client <em>need</em> all of this bumf?</p>\n<p>It all ties back to <a href=\"http://www.scrummable.com/making-like-a-mob-boss-knowing-your-problem-and-how-to-fix-it-2/\">the end goal of the site</a>. It may be that the client wants a rapidly-dating, awwward-winning website and, hopefully, they’ll come back to you next month for the replacement because the trendiest color has changed and they want to “re-brand”. More often than not, though, a client wants to achieve something grander than that. Awards for being awesome are lovely but they’re not the be-all and end-all of your brand &#8211; just ask <a href=\"https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/s/6-reasons-leonardo-dicaprio-has-never-won-an-oscar-091733412.html\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>!</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Mind your fingers on the cutting edge</h3>\n<p>As with the bread-and-butter elements of design; typography, imagery, and layout, bleeding-edge techniques should be used when relevant and <strong>at no other time</strong>. You wouldn’t consider using this week’s <em>font-du-jour</em> without justification, so why <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><a href=\"http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/web-design-trend-2013/\">fixed headers</a></span> <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"><a href=\"http://www.gibedigital.com/blog/2013/september/02/is-parallax-scrolling-web-design-dead/\">parallax backgrounds</a></span> <a href=\"http://www.itworld.com/article/2900889/web-design-trend-predictions-for-2016-2017.html\">Material Design</a>…?</p>\n",
