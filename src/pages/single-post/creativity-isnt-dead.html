			<h5>branding</h5>
			<p>Have you noticed that websites are all starting to look the same these days? A big hero image. Some over-sized type laid over the top. A call to action button. Then probably a row of three icons below that.</p>
<p>In fact, the phenomenon is so prevalent that it has been gaining attention <a title="Bootstrap" href="http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/" target="_blank">all-over the web</a> for a <a href="http://www.novolume.co.uk/blog/all-websites-look-the-same/" target="_blank">number of years</a> now. It’s the death of creativity isn’t it? It’s the industry taking their clients for a ride, right? Well no, actually. And here’s why: if a user arrives at your site and already knows how to use it, that’s a <a href="https://boagworld.com/design/why-all-websites-should-look-the-same/" target="_blank">good thing</a>. It’s just a case of knowing where to break the mould, and where to use patterns that are familiar. UX design isn’t the place to experiment. That rad new icon you’ve just designed for “settings” is going to confuse all of your users because they’re looking for a cog. That innovative new menu you’ve been working on is going to be useless if users have to work out how to use it.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean creativity is dead though. In fact it’s vital when it comes to communicating brand values. And they should come across at every point of contact.</p>
<p>A brand’s personality lives in its colour palette, in its typography, in its photography, in the way it talks. Google even has a set of <a href="https://material.google.com/motion/material-motion.html">animation guidelines</a> to outline what type of movement is on-brand. And too right – that’s absolutely part of the experience and another example of how creativity is essential in telling a brand’s story.</p>
<p>At Cube3, we build brands that are intuitive to interact with and we put creativity at the heart of our process. We find it’s a winning combination.</p>
